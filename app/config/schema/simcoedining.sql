She is a very positive and nice person, and she was exactly this in regards to an order that was messed up by the server. Well let me tell you, she walked in 5 minutes ago balling her eyes out because she has never been treated so horribly by a server & staff in her entire life. First off, she asked for a dairy free sandwich as she is severely allergic. The person at the counter ROLLED HER EYES and said "They ALL have dairy in them, hello...bread!" My sister then looked at her in confusion, as that is not true (breads are a GLUTEN product, and are generally dairy free). Moving on, she ordered a veggie wrap with chicken, minus cream cheese. The order proceeded to go to the wrong table. Then, when my sister received it, there was no chicken. She went up to the front to ask if they could put chicken on it-the server said "you didn\'t ask for it," my sister then said "...yes, I did...could I please have some chicken on this?". The server responded in another eye-rolling action and snotty tone "That\'ll take a while." Meanwhile, 40 minutes later, after the line-up out the door had ALL BEEN SERVED and the SERVER WAS CHOWING DOWN ON HER OWN LUNCH...my sister came up to the front to ask about her own lunch. The server responded "Well, we\'re all busy." Finally receiving her own lunch with chicken....she had to TAKE THE ORDER TO HER BUSINESS MEETING AND EAT IT THERE because of the neglect and pure rudeness of all the staff at Coffee Culture. And by the way, she was at a meeting regarding customer service...something that obviously Coffee Culture does not understand or hold in high regards!\n\nThe only good thing about this establishment in my sisters mind, was: \n\na) The person at another table (who didn\'t even know my sister but saw that her entire table had been served and everyone else in the establishment while she was still waiting) who pointed out to the servers that my poor sister was still waiting after the entire line had been served, and that...if the staff was so busy...why were they all eating their own lunch?\n\nand b) The new member of the team who is the only one who responded with any sort of decency....no doubt not yet poisoned by the rest of the team who all talked about my sister and glared at her behind the counter the entire time.\n\nWell, that is my review for you. Thank-you for making it abundantly clear that neither I nor any of my family or any person that I know will ever set foot in your terribly run and rude establishment.', NULL, 0, 0, 2, 1, '2011-10-04 22:07:46', NULL),

I bought a "Taste Of Barrie" coupon book, and inside there are 3 coupons for "Andy\'s Place".

The fine print reads: "Not valid on Holidays   must redeem coupon Valid until Dec 21/2012".\n\nToday is SUNDAY JULY 3rd. Upon presenting this coupon, my boyfriend was told it was a holiday, and that the coupon could not be used. He paid and left. When we regrouped in my car, he told me it wasn\'t valid. Upon returning home, I called "Andy\'s Place" and the Asian waitress answered. (If you\'ve ever been, you know there\'s only one.) I proceeded to ask her if she was being paid time and a half today for the "holiday". She didn\'t understand and after attempting to speak with her manager (who "wasn\'t in"), she told me she was not accepting any coupons all weekend.....which contradicts her ADVERTISED COUPON. I attempted SEVERAL TIMES to make it clear that today, JULY 3RD is NOT a holiday.

It was our first time in and we were not disappointed.\n\nWe started with breaded mushrooms ($7.99), a fair portion with a crisp, sweet breading and juicy mushrooms. The ranch dip was standard, and the dish could be upgraded by serving a horseradish sauce instead.\n\nMy wife chose the Ultimate Burger ($13.99), a half-pound of ground beef with sauteed mushrooms, bacon, cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce. The bun was crisped with a little butter and the burger was done perfectly. It was served with a mound of hand-cut fries.\n\nI ordered the Hot Hamburger ($15.99), listed as one of Scotty\'s specialities, and it showed. Two half-pound burgers are charbroiled and placed on a piece of grilled French bread, then smothered in brown gravy. The burger was chewy and flavourful, and the gravy was a perfect compliment. It was served with the Smashed Mashed ($4.99 or $2.69 extra in place of fries), which is a version of twice-baked potato with cheese and served in a side dish. It was good, not great. The dinner also came with cole slaw, a creamy treat although shredded a bit more than I prefer.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a single serving of bread pudding ($6.99). Quite simply, it was the best bread pudding I\'ve ever had. Restaurants and chefs that aren\'t trying make a mushy, cinnamony, wet glop that doesn\'t satisfy. This was a firm, sugary treat with an amazing caramel sauce and a small scoop of ice cream.\n\nAll in all, Scotty\'s is highly recommended!', NULL, 0, 0, 2, 1, '2011-07-09 18:02:48', NULL),

It&#8217;s not unusual for customers to stop by and ask Larry to sing the Neil Young tribute music he has professionally performed for many years. From day one, Larry has had a microphone and guitars set up for use at all times. He recently brought in an apartment sized piano for musicians to play.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29" title="Inside TLC Bistro and CafÃ©" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tlc-photos-3c.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="172" /></p>\n<p>Larry says, about the restaurant concept, that he &#8220;had no idea how it would turn out, but it just came together. I just knew I was going to combine my music and chef skills.&#8221; He has an entire corner of the restaurant dedicated to pictures of his music idol, Neil Young, and another wall dedicated to pictures of many famous Canadian musicians. There are many local music acts coming in to perform at the restaurant, and all of the acts are published in a flyer which is distributed on each table. As well as the full schedule of music acts coming through TLC, they do offer some really tasty eats.</p>\n<p>The food offering can be described as an exceptional choice of traditional breakfast; soups, salads, sandwiches and dessert; plus a nice selection of beers and wines. Unlike many restaurants in Barrie, TLC uses as many fresh and home style ingredients as they can. As a result, this makes the food better quality and even tastier. Many of the sauces are made from scratch, most of the baking is done in house, and I think TLC has the best chicken noodle/vegetable soup Iâ€™ve ever had. I&#8217;d like to think that it&#8217;s the music and friendly environment that Larry claims is his secret for success, but I also think he&#8217;s a little too modest to mention his chef skills are through the roof. Larry has over 30 years of professional chef service experience.</p>\n<p>Without question TLC is the perfect place for a lunch meeting, or the perfect way to get some good vibes rolling before a night on the town. Many of the customers are mingling with people they just met, especially on the Thursday open mic nights. TLC is a bit of a social hotspot even though you can certainly avail yourself of a more quiet and relaxed dining experience. The food is very enjoyable, and affordable; a combination that, in truth, cannot be said too much anymore.

Nikos said many thought it was some sort of Jamaican store, thinking Yammas was a play on Ya, Mon.</p>\n<p>It was not a long wait as the Patrianakos, who only moved up from Toronto May 1, opened Yammas on June 3. Itâ€™s on the north side of Mosley across from RONA.</p>\n<p>The varied Greek and Canadian menu features appetizers such as spanakopita and fried calamari, a wide variety of salads, burgers and sandwiches, halibut fish and chips and dinners ranging from veal cutlets to chicken and pork souvlaki. Among the dessert choices, we see Baklava, of course! And thereâ€™s a kidsâ€™ menu too.</p>\n<p>â€œI chose the open kitchen style so people can see whatâ€™s cooking, and they can smell,â€ Nikos said in an interview. â€œThatâ€™s the trend.

People say they want work and then they donâ€™t show up. â€œUntil I find the right people I have to be here.â€</p>\n<p>Currently, theyâ€™re offering a breakfast special starting at $4.99 and lunch specials are to begin in September.

One local woman, herself an excellent cook, was overheard to say that Yammasâ€™ Greek salad was the best sheâ€™d ever eaten. </p>\n<p>The idea to move to Wasaga Beach and open a restaurant here began to form years ago. â€œI always liked the area here when I visited from Toronto,â€ said Nikos. â€œI thought it would be good for me to work here for a few years and then it would be a good retirement home. More recently, he came up to visit a friend, also a restaurateur in the area, who said, â€˜why donâ€™t you open something in Wasaga Beach?â€™</p>\n<p>Then, Nikos did a survey, saw that the town was growing quickly and that there was a potential for business here. He said he felt that the people â€œneeded something different.â€</p>\n<p>Having arrived in Toronto from Greece in 1973, Nikos spent the next 38 years working in restaurants, 27 of those for himself. He recalled his first job was washing dishes. â€œThen, slowly, you work your way up.â€</p>\n<p>â€œI worked at the Astoria for about nine months,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s the busiest place on the Danforth, the original shish kabob place.â€</p>\n<p>Shhh! Niko revealed one of his secrets. â€œ I use pure olive oil which I bring from my village (in Greece).â€</p>\n<p>And, oh yes. I almost forgot. Yammas means â€œCheers!

From what I gather, there is no magical formula for restaurant success, but Club Ash continues to grow steadily within the Steakhouse niche and after spending a night there, I got to thinking that the good nature of its management staff plays a big role.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/club-ash-barrie.jpg" alt="" title="club-ash-barrie" width="588" height="286" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41" /> </p>\n<p>Since its January 2012 opening, advertising hasnâ€™t been a major factor in early success for Ash. Marcello, the owner likes the word of mouth clientele he is receiving.  He told me he has done no advertising yet, and relies mainly on his customer response. </p>\n<p>In my opinion, there really is no harm in relying on word of mouth when the restaurant has something to sincerely boast about.  So I had to try the food to see what the buzz was about.</p>\n<p>From the moment you walk into Club Ash, the atmosphere is impressive; itâ€™s hard to imagine anything but the finest fares in this chic and classy environment.  Even the lighting was appetizing.  At first I questioned my appearance, though I quickly noticed everyone in the restaurant had dressed casually too.</p>\n<p>Thoughtfully, there was evidence showing that a great deal of concern had been taken to create an extremely comfortable dining experience. Of course, Iâ€™m talking about the extra-large tables, which are roomy enough for a foursome or more, and the spacious distance between other tables.</p>\n<p>As for menu options, I felt as though I would have liked to try it all.  However I felt like a marinated steak on this occasion, so I tried the Marinated Flank Steak 8oz ($20) which is prepared in a 24 hour marinade.  The entrees come with the option of adding either: fried sweet potatoes, roasted red potatoes, or creamy mashed potatoes.  The server clearly noted that I could also substitute the side of potatoes for a house salad.</p>\n<p>After having the flank steak, I was able to thank the chef for his work with the grill.  He told me â€œYou wonâ€™t find a cut like that anywhere else in Barrie.â€</p>\n<p>At first, I was very tempted to go with the restaurantâ€™s pasta alternative but, now Iâ€™m glad I went with the steak.  I am not the first person to have been very pleased with the steak fares at Ash.  Iâ€™ve heard two people tell me â€œif you like steak, you should try Club Ash.â€  And after dinner, I met up with some friends, and was soon passing the word on myself.</p>\n<p>Before I could leave, I was drawn into the wonderful jazz music that was being performed live.  It was so subtle and dulcet that it would not intrude on talking and friendly conversation.  It was really the perfect backdrop. As I sat at the bar, winding down a wonderful time at Club Ash, I had a couple European-style espressos which were prepared behind the bar.</p>\n<p>Without question, there are multiple ways to include Club Ash in your downtown Barrie experiences, any day of the week.  For nightlife, itâ€™ll ring your bell, and likewise for some fine dining.  The dinner jazz is from 6-9PM on Thursdays to Sundays.</p>\n<p>-Written by: Michael Whone<br />\nFollow Michael Whone on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/whoneranger/" target="_blank">@whoneranger</a> and visit his website: <a href="http://www.rivervanstyle.com" target="_blank">www.rivervanstyle.com</a></p>\n', 'Right in the heart of downtown Barrieâ€™s bustling Dunlop Street, Club Ash is proving to be one of the most elegant dining and night club experiences the city has to offer.', 'Note: Club Ash is now closed, enjoy this look back to 2012.

This varied skill set enabled her to glean a wealth of knowledge that now serves both her business and her customers very, very well. Highly successful in the corporate world, pushing paper was wearing thin, a random request to bring<br />\ndessert to her nephewâ€™s birthday party was the inspired moment. Baking up a batch of flavourful cupcakes, topped with phenomenal buttercream icing, her family went berserk asking â€œwhy arenâ€™t you doing this for a livingâ€? On a whim she designed a logo, folded boxes, slapped on labels and positioned samples in the lunchroom of her office. Her colleagues had the same reaction, word of mouth created orders and soon after, Cheeky Treats burst on the scene. The funky and fashionable cupcake mobile, frequents the Barrie Farmers Market, 400 Market and a myriad of other locales. Coming soon, a free standing cupcakes and more store, at 188 Owen Street in Barrie.</p>\n<p>Quality is Nadiaâ€™s mantra; she is the only baker, this guarantees consistency, as a perfectionist, she maintains full control of products leaving her kitchen. When you choose your favorite cheeky flavour, it<br />\nwill be the same indulgent treat the next time. Made with all natural ingredients, real butter, no preservatives or colouring, (other then the classic Red Velvet), Nadia has created 360 flavours of<br />\ncupcakes. Other cheeky delights include; whoopee pies, creamy cheesecake, gourmet pies, fabulous cookies, brownie pops, butter tarts, and funnel cakes. For the late night party goers, a new savoury addition to the menu is Black Angus Farm Gate sausages.</p>\n<p>These Cheeky baristas are dispensing wit and humour along with the cappuccinos, lattes, ice coffees, lemonade, and teas. Nadia is able to meet a variety of dietary needs including gluten free, diabetic, lactose free, vegan and organic.</p>\n<p>Now letâ€™s talk waffles, or as Nadia refers to it, the â€œget cheeky in bedâ€ option. Shawn and Nadia have incorporated a waffle delivery service to their repertoire, creating waffles topped with fresh blueberry or strawberry sauce, whipping cream and maple syrup. You call to order and they deliver straight to your homeâ€¦can you say Sunday brunch?</p>\n<p>The cupcake mobile allows freedom and has created a following all around Simcoe; from the Farmers Market to late nights on Dunlop, to the wilds of Wasaga, while the Owen Street shop will give these two cheeky entrepreneurs a home base, offering all items on their present menu, including fresh cut fries, poutine, and soft serve ice cream. In addition, stocking competitively priced food basics, milk, bread and cheese.</p>\n<p>Cheeky Treats on Owen Street will be far more then a bakery; a continuation of the goals of these two energetic and committed people, running a family business. Nadia and Shawn aim to assure that they provide you with the best culinary experience possible; their service is personalized, personified!</p>\n<p>Letâ€™s talk flavours; with 360 options, the top dozen usually available, I strongly suggest you drop by the cheeky mobile to choose.

Deep-fried pickles are the staff favourite, offered at $7.49. The menu also lists double-stacked nachos, with the option of adding chicken or beef. Also, you can choose from wraps, burgers, beef dip, or â€œsnake bitesâ€ (cream cheese filled jalapeno peppers in batter), or try their kettle chips. A kidâ€™s menu is also available.  </p>\n<p>During my recent meal at Mittyâ€™s, our server was very professional, patient, and friendly. He didnâ€™t rush the visit and knew when to check in. The only complaint I have is that upon my recent visit and some of my previous ones, the food has not been up to standard in freshness, and sometimes, itâ€™s overdone.

Lawna explained that small weddings are often booked at Crazy Fox Bistro, with the wedding couple taking their vows on the balcony while guests gather on the lower level.

Live music was offered up by â€œPagans Follyâ€, with pipes and fiddles, their passion for Celtic music was fitting for the venue.</p>\n<p>Lynn Ogryzlo, author of the â€œOntario Tableâ€ cookbook, was in attendance for a book signing and invited all to sign the Ontario table-cloth, pledging support for local food. As she eloquently points out; â€œIf every household in Ontario spent $10 a week on local food; weâ€™d have an additional 2.4 billion in our local economy at the end of the year. Keeping our money circulating grows those dollars to $3.6 billion and creates 10,000 new jobs.â€</p>\n<p>I was struck by the palpable sensation of camaraderie among the vendors, the farmers, the chefs, all working together not only to provide us with a tasty afternoon spent sampling, but to encourage and educate us on the inherent goodness of our local foods. This afternoon takes us back to the time when we could taste the nutrients, rather then read it on a label. I found this event had a strong passionate undercurrent of inspiration for us; to feed our bodies, our souls, and our local economy with the goodness that is real food.</p>\n<p>While Savour Simcoe is sadly but a once yearly event, we have the opportunity any day of the week to savour the flavour of the local bounty by dining at the local establishments that participated in today&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to shop and dine locally, and earmark the Simcoe Savour website, your taste buds will be glad you did!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.simcoecountyfarmfresh.ca/savoursimcoe">http://www.simcoecountyfarmfresh.ca/savoursimcoe</a></p>\n<p>-Written by: Penelope Morrow</p>\n<p><em>Penelope Morrow is a writer, editor and food aficionado from Barrie; follow her tweets at <a href="http://twitter.com/penelopejmorrow" title="@penelopejmorrow" target="_blank">@penelopejmorrow</a></em></p>\n', 'The sunlight filtered down through the evergreens this afternoon, providing dappled shade for those attending the fifth annual Savour Simcoe, a celebration of Agriculture and Regional Cuisine', 'Hosted by Simcoe County Farm Fresh Marketing Association Non-Profit Inc.

On this re-acquaintance with SPICE, I noticed that I wasnâ€™t over-dressed, however if a semi-formal atmosphere is what youâ€™re looking for, you need to look no further.</p>\n<p>During our quaint lunch I observed that there was a significant office-worker client base. It struck me as a bit of a surprise because Indian food is notorious for heavy spice quantities. In defense of the food, on which I will later expand, it only took one buffet plate for me to realize the broad appeal to patrons on a lunch-break. When I first stepped into the restaurant I was intimidated by the chic dÃ©cor. Its exquisite interior, fine cutlery, and well chosen china blended nicely with the non-Canadian menu options. SPICE is a culinary escape from our Canadian norms.</p>\n<p>There were Canadian sides like coleslaw and macaroni salad; on top of that there were enough options, on the buffet menu, to fully service a vegetarian diet. Ultimately, what won over my guest and I, were the authentic Indian treats. Samosas are slowly growing into a popular American snack because of the heavy pastry content. However, after trying SPICE, I can now say that samosas are only made best by true Indian chefs. And no Indian meal would be complete without the curry. Between the two of us, we enjoyed probably the finest butter chicken and curried beef Barrie has to offer, for the price.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57" title="Spice Indian wine bar Barrie" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spice-indian.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="250" srcset="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spice-indian-300x127.jpg 300w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spice-indian-120x51.jpg 120w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spice-indian-500x212.jpg 500w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spice-indian.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>\n<p>As for the amount of spice that you think may be troublesome to withstand, I found the spice factor was actually quite minimal. Iâ€™m not a person who can handle copious amounts of spice either, but the restaurant wasnâ€™t anything like Hollywoodâ€™s portrayal of Indian restaurants. In movies, you always see people rushing for the bathroom, like they had just polished off a can of Metamucil. In the case of SPICE, this couldnâ€™t be farther from the truth. In fact, the SPICE website discusses some of the health benefits of the spices that are used in many of the menu choices.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended"><b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/rawlicious-barrie">Rawlicious in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barries-royal-thai-cuisine">Barrieâ€™s Royal Thai Cuisine</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/savour-simcoe-2013">Savour Simcoe 2013</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>For instance, about cinnamon, it says â€œDetoxifying herb, creates freshness, strengthens and energizes the tissues.

It is also a great starter for your night out because the Indian food selection is, in a good way, going to be culturally-provocative in terms of conversation and mood. And whatâ€™s best is you wonâ€™t be left with a huge tab. Our two-person buffet cost us only $27.00 with two soft drinks. Considering that a Chinese buffet for two will easily put you over the $30.00 threshold, SPICE is really a great deal, because it just has way more class.</p>\n<p>-Written by: Michael Whone</p>\n<p><em>Follow Michael Whone on Twitter <a title="@whoneranger" href="http://twitter.com/whoneranger" target="_blank">@whoneranger</a> and visit his website: <a title="www.rivervanstyle.com" href="http://www.rivervanstyle.com" target="_blank">www.rivervanstyle.com</a></em></p>\n<p>Hours of Operation:<br />\nLunch<br />\n11:30 â€“ 2:30 PM<br />\nDinner<br />\n5:00 â€“ 9:00 PM<br />\n5:00 â€“ 10:00 PM (Fri-Sat)</p>\n<p>16 Dunlop Street East,<br />\nBarrie, ON</p>\n<div style="text-align: center">Sponsored By:</div>\n<p><strong><em>Visit <a href="http://www.wineman.co.uk/brand/sula-indian-wines" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Wineman</a> for restaurant quality Wines, direct to you. <a href="http://www.wineman.co.uk/brand/sula-indian-wines" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Wineman</a> sells remarkable Indian wines from Sula in India.

I wandered into Rawlicious on a Monday afternoon. Its size makes it easy to miss, but this smaller restaurant is clean, modern, and bright. </p>\n<p>The atmosphere is warm and inviting with coffeehouse music playing in the background; however, itâ€™s unclear whether you should seat yourself or walk up to the counter, and no oneâ€™s really there to make it clear. Despite its small appearance, Rawlicious is a restaurant, so learn from my experience and have a seat. When one of the servers does appear from the back room, theyâ€™re quite friendly and knowledgeable; however, be prepared to wait. Although everything is raw, it seems the process of preparation takes several minutes, even for a simple item.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rawlious-barrie.jpg" alt="" title="rawlious-barrie" width="588" height="338" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-61" /></p>\n<p>If youâ€™re visiting for a light lunch, Rawlicious has a variety of organic salads. You can choose: House, Caesar, Olive-Currant-Nut and Seed, Taco, or Strawberry Pecan Salad (which is only available in the summer). If youâ€™re still hungry, Rawlicious has a variety of wraps, which are much different than typical ones, due to their food being gluten-free. For instance, their Caesar and taco wraps are wrapped in collard leaves. Also on the menu is the â€œRawitch,â€ which is onion bread with guacamole, tomatoes, cucumbers, and alfalfa sprouts, dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. Rawlicious pizza is the only warm entrÃ©e on the menu; it is made on a sprouted buckwheat and flax seed crust with cashew nut cheese and typically has a tomato marinara sauce. Rawlicious also has pastas, such as Zucchetti Rose, Pasta Bolognese, and Pad Thai. However, none of these items have cooked noodles, as one of the servers said: â€œWe donâ€™t cook anything.â€ He also said their pastas were more like â€œsaladsâ€.

They are absolutely delicious and will leave you craving more. Itâ€™s no wonder these small balls made with coconut, cashew, vanilla, and maple syrup are their best seller. </p>\n<p>Overall, Rawlicious is worth the experience, although it is far too pricy to visit on a regular basis. I was tempted to try the Strawberry Milkshake, which is made with nutmilk, strawberries, avocado, agave, and vanilla; however, I opted for a warm cup of chocolate Chai tea, due to the smoothieâ€™s price tag. Wraps and salads start at $9.00. You can pay up to $16.00 for a small entrÃ©e, not to mention their smoothies and drinks start around $7.00/each. At the same time, you get what you pay for and if youâ€™re looking for a healthy, organic, and vegan option the next time you eat out, Rawlicious definitely contains enough raw goodness to please your taste buds. </p>\n<p>The restaurant is open Sunday-Thursday 11:00am â€“ 9:00pm.

Oddly enough, my friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant for the entire duration of our meal. Monsoonâ€™s has a very posh design, with black, leather padded seating (sofas and singular seats) creating an overall comfortable, classy environment. There is no one to seat you when you walk in, so you can sit anywhere you would like. The restaurant is fairly large, with a very spacious bar if youâ€™re only interested in going for a few drinks. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/monsoon-lounge.jpg" alt="monsoon-lounge" width="588" height="302" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101" /></p>\n<p>If you enjoy martinis then I am certain you will be in Wonderland when you look at the drink menu. Monsoonâ€™s has 101 martinis â€“ it was so difficult to choose only one! The martinis range from a variety of sugary sweetness to strongly liquored, as well as appeal to the sci-fi lovers and the girly-girls. Monsoonâ€™s has surely covered all of their bases where martinis are concerned. Searching through the never-ending drink menu, I finally decided on a Butterfly Martini â€“ a blue-green concoction that appealed to my sweet tooth and made my taste buds soar. </p>\n<p>Our waiter for the evening was very attentive, friendly, and quick with our drink orders. He was also helpful in suggesting the best of Monsoonâ€™s martinis. Being a very picky vegetarian, it is difficult to find food that I actually enjoy, but Monsoonâ€™s greatly impressed me. The menu is centered on rolls, sushi, and sashimi, but there are many options available. I ordered a Japanese Garden Salad, which consisted of organic greens, cucumbers, carrots, and was dressed with a sesame-ginger vinaigrette. My friend and I also shared Thai Lettuce Wraps â€“ leaves of lettuce topped with carrots, cucumbers, sprouts, and mint, with a peanut sauce to complete. The meal was absolutely stupendous. Another friend of mine ordered Yam Rolls and Sake Sushi (Atlantic salmon rolled with rice and vegetables). We were all very pleased with the quality of the food and the delicious taste. </p>\n<p>The prices vary from around $6 to $13 depending on the meal you purchase. The portions are large, so make sure you visit with a big appetite. The only downside was that the food took a while to prepare, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. You are given chop-sticks to eat with â€“ a hard feat for beginners, but it is a simple skill that takes only a few moments to master. If you are unable to use chop-sticks, however, forks can be provided. Other than the long wait, we were full to the brim and very satisfied. </p>\n<p>I inquired about the nightlife, and the waiter informed me that Monsoonâ€™s is a popular venue on Friday and Saturday nights for customers looking for a classy pre-drink before they hit the town. Monsoonâ€™s is a perfect lounge area to gather with friends, and also hear live music on certain nights.</p>\n<p>Located at 140 Dunlop Street East, just past Manhattanâ€™s, Monsoonâ€™s is closed on Sunday and Monday, but opens at 4pm every other day of the week. Itâ€™s a little hard to spot, so make sure you are paying attention while driving by. If youâ€™re ever in the mood for an affordable and delectable meal I suggest you try out Monsoonâ€™s â€“ you will not be disappointed. </p>\n<p><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/monsoon-lounge-barrie" title="Monsoon Barrie" target="_blank">Monsoon&#8217;s Profile</a></p>\n<p><em>Valerie Colangelo is a writer from Barrie.

White knuckle driving aside, theÂ opportunity to learn the inspiration behind this foodieâ€™s favourite festival was well worth it!</p>\n<p>I was handed a great cup of coffee to warm my hands, and comfortably settled in to interview number one, with Randy Feltis, who with Ryan Traversy, created Barrielicious. In the winter of 2006, taking their cue from the success of Torontoâ€™s â€œWinterliciousâ€, this duo successfully convinced 16 independent privately owned restaurateurs to create extraordinary three course meals, for the bargain price of $20.06 and run a two week festival. Mid-winter, the post-holiday, pre Valentines season is traditionally a slow period in the food industry, but interest in Barrielicious created an outpouring of customers, and all involved were thrilled with the success of the venture, and so it continues, year after year. Barrielicous is a great opportunity to shake off the winter blahs and enjoy the diverse offerings of the finest independent restaurants in Simcoe. While Randy and Ryan were hoping for success, Barrielicious was the biggest thing they had seen in their restaurants. Another upside of the festival was that it brought together a diverse group of restaurant owners, chefs, and staff, sharing a common goal, of impressing the heck out of the influx of diners. They worked hard, had fun and ran a successful event. Barrielicious winter edition was so successful, that a summer version was planned and runs in early July.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-109" alt="Barrielicious 2013" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/barrielicious2013.jpg" width="588" height="158" /></p>\n<p>Barrielicious is an opportunity for local independent restaurants to showcase their talents, create a cornucopia of delicious feasts and offer them to diners at a greatly reduced rate over a two week period. I highly recommend you bundle up and head out in the snow; foodies will delight in the opportunity to see what their fav chefs are creating, occasional diners will discover stunning independent restaurants and bargain diners will be satiated. Many folks are reluctant to try a new restaurant, but this festival entices and educates, showcasing the extensive variety of fine dining venues and culinary talents in our region.Once through the door, the staff, from server to chef, delight in impressing diners, as they know when there is a special occasion to celebrate, a birthday or anniversary, that well-fed diners will fondly remember their great Barrielicious meal and head back to said memorable restaurant, this time knowing they are in for an elysian delight, which will be well worth the regular cost. These are special event restaurants.Over the years I have dined at a majority of the restaurants involved with Barrielicious, with very few disappointments.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/evening-manhattans-bar-kitchen">A Night at Manhattanâ€™s Bar &#038; Kitchen</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/review-spice-indian-wine-bar-barrie">SPICE Indian Cuisine and Wine Bar in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/february-blues-xvii">The February Blues XVII</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Barrielicious was purchased this year by Andy Wilson who also owns the rights to the popular Londonlicious event, which runs simultaneously. Ryan Traversy remains as the General Manager of Barrielicious. Andy assured me that the integrity of the festival will continue, the focus remains on showcasing independently owned restaurants. Suggestions for you gentle readers; especially for those attempting your first gastronomical leap into Barrielicious. Reservations are a must, some restaurants do three seatingâ€™s an evening,others stagger the times so there is no sense of being rushed. While all restaurants abide by the fix price menu, there are many that offer upcharges, allowing you to order from their regular menu.Some restaurants have an automatic gratuity for their servers; it is worth asking when you make your reservation. We hope most diners recognize that the meal they are served is priced well below typical norm and will tip accordingly, rather than just calculating a 15% option. The staff work hard and are deserving of our appreciation by way of a generous tip.</p>\n<p>Barrielicious Blizzard Edition 2013 was once again a phenomenal success; mark your calendars for Barrielicious â€“ Heat Wave Edition, coming this summer to Simcoe and prepare to be impressed!</p>\n<p>Barrielicious Festival<br />\nwww.barrielicious.com<br />\nRyan Traversy<br />\nryantraversy@hotmail.com<br />\n705 770 4363</p>\n<p>Written by: Penelope Morrow</p>\n<p><em>Penelope Morrow is a writer, editor and food aficionado from Barrie, follow her tweets @<a title="@penelopejmorrow" href="http://twitter.com/penelopejmorrow" target="_blank">penelopejmorrow</a></em></p>\n', 'Barrielicious is an opportunity for local independent restaurants to showcase their talents, create a cornucopia of delicious feasts and offer them to diners at a greatly reduced rate over a two week period.

I am somewhat reluctant to share this hidden gem with my readers, but I simply canâ€™t keep this jewel to myself. </p>\n<p>Manager Tania Gregorie spoke with me over a cup of â€œDeep Green Embraceâ€ tea, sharing that advertising for the Radio CafÃ© has not been necessary. Since opening 12 years ago, word of mouth<br />\nbrought the customers in, while the good food and unique surroundings keep them coming back. City Hall staffers, courtroom lawyers, gallery patrons, college students, tourists and locals alike are all frequent customers. </p>\n<p>The Radio CafÃ© is ideally situated; front and center of the gallery, with exquisitely creative tables, comfy club chairs, all nicely spaced on two levels. In winter the fireplace beckons, and then come patio season, umbrella tables extend the dining space out into the Massie Family Sculpture Court.  The building is an architectural landmark, combining the renovated Carnegie Library with state of the art galleries. Renowned sculpture artist, John McEwen, created the stunning â€œStar Wallâ€ which lines the sloping walkway, from cafÃ© entry to the lower level framing studio. His work also graces the outdoor sculpture court. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/radio-cafe-2.jpg" alt="radio-cafe-2" width="588" height="216" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-111" /></p>\n<p>The Radio CafÃ© is both spacious and intimate, it is an ideal atmosphere to read work or study, Wi-Fi is available, ambiance abounds.

Nicole Di Pinto, owner of Grounded Coffee Company in Midland, first experienced this world wide event in London Ontario. When serendipity returned Nicole to Midland, she brought with her the passion, energy and organizational skills to become the dynamic driving force behind this delicious event. Nicole and her cohort, Library Program Assistant, Scott Cooper successfully inspired local chefs and restaurant owners to creative heights. Chief Librarian Bill Molesworth, fully supported this venture, and on Sunday was seen enjoying the flavours of the day. The second annual Books2Eat festival was a huge success, raising funds for the Midland Public Library.

Hoffberg, a librarian herself, and Beatrice Coron, who created the Books2Eat website, where with a few clicks of the keyboard you will find jaw dropping, mouthwatering images of the gastronomical goodies inspired by the chefs book choice. The internet allows ease of sharing the pictures and is part of the goal, making the festival visually accessible to all. </p>\n<p>As a good book can feed the soul, the edible offerings based on great books can feed a library full of bibliophiles and food loving patrons quite satisfactorily!</p>\n<p>The community supports this event; students in the culinary class at Penetang Secondary School made and served sweet and savory appetizers to the eager throngs.

This pub is rather dimly lit, so it can be difficult to see the dinner and drink menu until you adjust to the lighting, but it creates a calm, friendly atmosphere. British Arms has a wide variety of beers, and the bartender can create just about any drink or shot that you desire.</p>\n<p>Unless your sole intent is to share appetizers, make sure you come to British Arms hungry, or that you do not order too much for yourself, because the portion sizes are rather large. Do not fret, however â€“ the server would be glad to supply you with a doggy-bag to bring home your unfinished meal. British Arms offers quite a varied menu while keeping true to the British favourites. Depending on how much one decides to order, a person can dine for under $30 and be utterly spoiled. From a wide selection of burgers, traditional fish and chips, and poutine, to the salads and scrumptious appetizers, British Arms has certainly covered all of the bases when it comes to variety &#8211; it will be hard to settle on just one option.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119" alt="british-arms" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/british-arms.jpg" width="588" height="223" /></p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/evening-manhattans-bar-kitchen">A Night at Manhattanâ€™s Bar &#038; Kitchen</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/dinner-donaleighs-irish-pub">Dinner at Donaleighâ€™s Irish Pub</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/simcoedinings-barrie-patio-guide-2013">SimcoeDiningâ€™s Barrie Patio Guide</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Being a vegetarian, I am unable to enjoy any of the options with meat, but I have gone with numerous friends on several occasions and they have all raved about how brilliant their meals were. British Arms is vegetarian friendly, and the staff is more than willing to accommodate individual needs whatever they may be. To begin our meal, my friends and I shared a platter of nachos and sweet potato wedges â€“ let the feast begin! This was a delicious, filling start to our evening. We were pleased as our meal came out in a timely fashion, allowing us to enjoy the wine and appetizers we ordered. My server, without having been asked, added more walnuts and cheese to my Market Salad seeing that the meatless salad was lacking. This was a salad composed of mixed greens layered with slices of green apple, walnuts, and crumbled blue cheese all tossed in a toasted sesame vinaigrette â€“ it was absolutely marvelous! A friend of mine tried the Apple Butter BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. She was very pleased with the quality of the meal and boasted of how delicious the caramelized onions complimented the Apple Butter BBQ sauce that was drizzled on the pork.</p>\n<p>On Friday and Saturday nights, British Arms is the perfect pub to go for drinks and enjoy live music (the music is rather loud at times making it difficult to hear oneâ€™s friends), but if you go near the back of the pub it is easier to hear your conversations. Having servers that take care of your drink orders, one is also able to order anything off the menu until 1:00 am â€“ there is nothing that better compliments alcohol than good food.</p>\n<p>British Arms Pub is snugly located at 29 Dunlop Street East; make sure to keep a keen eye because you can easily pass the pub without notice. During the summer months, there is a nice patio where one can sit with an ice cold beer enjoying the warm breeze and live music. If you are interested in sharing in a little piece of the British culture, I highly suggest British Arms Pub for a memorable evening.</p>\n<p><a title="British Arms pub" href="http://www.simcoedining.com/british-arms" target="_blank">Visit British Arms&#8217; Profile</a></p>\n<p><em>Valerie Colangelo is a writer from Barrie.

Live music was provided by Michelle Guy and Brad Hilliker.</p>\n<p>Christine McSorley, Manager of the Georgian Dining Room, Catering and Events, explained that the goal of the Chef and Wine series is to connect students with Chefs and resorts in Simcoe County and beyond. This provides students with opportunities to enhance their learning, which in turn connects those creating food with the broader community, so that fortunate souls, like myself can dine, wine and socialize with other foodies while enjoying a splendid meal. Another perk of the Chef Series is the opportunity for all to view the Chef du jour in action, as they demonstrate and educate all present. While I am but an occasional sipper of spirits, it wasnâ€™t a challenge to enlist a dear friend as designated drinker. I consumed but a mere mouthful of each proffered vino but was duly impressed.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" alt="wine-chief-1" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wine-chief-1.jpg" width="588" height="233" /></p>\n<p>We started with a Cabert Prosecco, while hors dâ€™oeuvres were served; as apparently â€œbubbles open the palateâ€. Mixed Vegetable Bhaji, Smoked Mushroom Croquettes and Roasted Beet and Feta Bites were served with finesse by students. Designated drinker and I wanted to take a tray of Vegetable Bhaji home for nibbling, they were amazing.</p>\n<p>AndrÃ© Sanche is not only an Executive Chef, but also an informed local food advocate, he sources ingredients of the highest quality for his cooking. Chef AndrÃ© educated us as he fed us,Â sharing tidbits of his vast knowledge. I for one was pleased to learn that my fondness for Kozlikâ€™s Mustard is well placed, as apparently 85% of the worldâ€™s Dijon Mustard is grown in Canada.</p>\n<p>Those fancy French Dijonâ€™s that adorn store shelves may have been made in France with Canadian mustard seed, so why not purchase local, as in doing so, we are supporting local producers, growersÂ and keeping more money at home.

The first days settling into my new community I was on a mission to locate the stores and shops that I would frequent.  A priority was to locate an all -scratch bakery that made butter tarts. Butter tarts are my comfort food, a taste that says welcome.  I needed to find my perfect butter tart, and at Hollyâ€™s, perfection came with a warning. If I wasnâ€™t going to sit and order tea to accompany said butter tart, it was strongly suggested that I wait until I arrived home to eat it. I should have listened, but it was far too tempting; the pastry was flaky, with desired crispness, the filling was abundant, and as I munched into it, the gooey wonderfulness dripped on my steering wheel.  I was sold and promptly needed to return for more.  </p>\n<p>Over the years I have nibbled and noshed my way through most of the amazing items they offer. Hollyâ€™s Sweets and Eats is much more than the best bakery Barrie has; they specialize in wedding and birthday cakes, artisan  breads, muffins, scones and pies, squares and cookies. At holiday time you can bring in your own pie pan or borrow a stunning fluted version, to present your pie most uniquely. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/holly-2.jpg" alt="holly-2" width="588" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" srcset="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/holly-2-300x127.jpg 300w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/holly-2-120x51.jpg 120w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/holly-2-500x212.jpg 500w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/holly-2.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>\n<p>They smoke their own meats for succulent Panini sandwiches. Their corned beef sandwiches have that desired Montreal flavour! They offer frozen meals and create corporate lunches. Sample their simply amazing savory items.  Giftware, gift baskets, and gluten free foods. </p>\n<p>Catering and cooking lessons. Jams, jellies and preserves. Order a Romantic Valentines dinner; indulge in a traditional Motherâ€™s Day High tea, my darling daughter and I did just that this past week.  Add some elegance to your Christmas Festivities. All are exemplary, the quality consummate. </p>\n<p>Saturday breakfasts are stunning, eggs benedict, pancakes with Loriâ€™s own pure maple syrup. Dinner for 50, no problem, they even make the condiments to accompany the fine fare. I can personally attest to the quality of the amazing cakes, having blown out the candles on many birthdays.  I was a satisfied customer when I experienced the creativity of their custom offerings, as the perfect summer  box lunches were made for a writing workshop I co-hosted. </p>\n<p>Frozen or prepared sticky buns, sublime cinnamon swirl loaves, these make the best French toast. The Hot Cross buns, are delicious, I wish they made them throughout the spring.</p>\n<p>Pop in for your early morning coffee and muffin, or try a scone. Swing by for lunch, the daily specials are wonderful. Drop by to pick up dinner to go, the steak and mushroom pies are a favourite of mine.

She also took great patience with our indecisiveness when choosing our meals and drinks.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135" alt="clarkson-2" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/clarkson-2.jpg" width="588" height="300" /></p>\n<p>The Clarkson Pub has a fairly selective menu with options that are not entirely normal of most restaurants. Many of the appetizers were focused around sea-food, but the rest of the menu had a good variety of fish, meats, and vegetarian meals. It was quite refreshing to have so many uncommon meal options. Being unable to choose only one, my friends and I decided to share a few appetizers â€“ we had Sweet Potato Frites, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Coconut Shrimp, as well as an Antipasto Platter (a platter consisting of sliced meats, an assortment of cheeses, as well as green and black olives, vegetables, and oiled bread). For dinner I decided to have a Clarkson Green Salad â€“ a salad composed of mixed greens, chopped cucumbers, avocado, carrot, and radish, but I added crumbled goat cheese and finished the salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I was absolutely enthralled with how delicious this salad was. One of my friends ordered the Veggie Wrap, and another ordered the Chicken Quesadillas â€“ a flour tortilla that was stuffed with chicken, peppers, onion, and layered with pepper jack cheese, sour cream and salsa. The entire table was thoroughly impressed with the quality and taste of the food, and the portion sizes were small enough so as not to overeat, but big enough to feel satisfied.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136" alt="clarkson-3" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/clarkson-3.jpg" width="588" height="350" /></p>\n<p>There is a fair selection of drink options, ranging from domestic beers to martinis and mixed drinks. I had an Envy Martini â€“ all I can say about this beverage is if you like tequila then this is definitely your drink. The martinis are very strong, but they certainly get the job done well. A couple of my friends had the Caesars and said that they were delectably spicy. With an appetizer, main course and a martini, I dined for under $25. The Clarkson Pub is affordable, the food is wonderful, and the atmosphere is very inviting. I will definitely dine at The Clarkson Pub again.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/dinner-grilled-cheese-social-eatery">Dinner at the Grilled Cheese Social Eatery</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/night-british-arms">A night at the British Arms</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/simcoedinings-barrie-patio-guide-2013">SimcoeDiningâ€™s Barrie Patio Guide</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>To keep the pub full of entertainment, Jukebox Bingo takes place on Mondays and Karaoke is on Tuesday nights.

I was introduced to his fine fare when a friend started a new job in Midland and raved to me about the scones, the lunches and the bountiful take out options. My palate was teased and tempted by the offerings she would deliver for me to try.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to savour first hand, Chef Andreâ€™s culinary expertise at the Midland Public Libraryâ€™s â€œBooks2Eatâ€ event, a few months past, and then again, at the recent Wine and Chef Series dinner at Georgian College.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" alt="ciboulette-2" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ciboulette-2.jpg" width="588" height="358" /></p>\n<p>With the weather turning towards spring, the time was right for a road trip. Meandering along Highway 93, my thoughts tuned to lunch options and I arrived with an appetite.</p>\n<p>Ciboulette et Cie is in the heart of downtown Midland. I was duly impressed with the strong sense of community values shown by Chef Andre and the other local proprietors as I explored King Street.</p>\n<p>Local is the key word as Andre Sanche strongly supports locally sourced foods and sustainably grown products. This is evident not only in the superb fare coming forth from the open kitchen, but in the well-stocked shelves; overflowing with products both made in house and from local suppliers. Looking for pickled garlic scapes, they have them, a wondrous wooden bowl, it is there. Charcuterie and cheeses, dips and spreads, delicious desserts, gluten free goodies, catering options and cooking classes. Belly ice-cream, Nateâ€™s Bagels and Sheldon Creek Dairy products are all available. Ciboulette et Cie has it all. Well stocked freezers provide take home choices. Space design gives a nod to the general stores of days gone past; with wood floors and benches, and chalk board signage assists customers to find what they are seeking, urges them to explore what is in store.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" alt="ciboulette-1" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ciboulette-1.jpg" width="588" height="228" /></p>\n<p>My dining companion and I both ordered the daily soups; one a gingered carrot, the other a beefy vegetable, both were rich and flavorful. I wish I had better understood the process for creating a phenomenal sandwich, but my simple grilled cheese was still a solid choice. While sipping a great cafÃ© au lait, I enjoyed a lush lemon square, while my friend found the vegan vanilla coconut macaroon to be a great choice. Chef Andre sent me home with fresh fiddleheads to cook and a quinoa salad, both were greatly enjoyed.</p>\n<p>Chef Andre did wax poetic while sharing his food philosophy with me; that being, food is a part of everyoneâ€™s day, whether one is happy or sad, we have our daily experiences but we all need to eat, so why not put the emphasis on good food. For him it is a joy to prepare, share and teach others what it means to eat good food. Eating should be an experience!</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/9th-annual-chef-wine-series-2013-georgian-dining-room">9th Annual Chef and Wine Series 2013 Georgian Dining Room</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/books2eat-event-midland-library">A feast for the senses at Books2Eat at the Midland Library</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/10fold-farms-feast-summer-ciboulette-cie">10fold farms â€œFeast on Summerâ€ with Ciboulette et Cie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Chef Andreâ€™s support for his community is evidenced in many ways; he has been teaching a dual credit class at Georgian College, as he believes strongly that teaching youth the skills to cook, helps to prepare them for life. Additionally he is a key champion for â€œStart Local: a truly local film projectâ€, created by Nate Lacroix and Ashley Matt. This is a documentary exploring the tremendous value of local shopping and the impact that supporting local has on this one community. Chef Andre supports local fundraising efforts, by donating $25 gift cards; he views this as an opportunity for him to share his great fare with others, while introducing them in the store, to the local experience. â€œDinner for 8â€ is an extremely popular charity auction event held annually to benefit Community Living Huronia. Clients of Community Living Huronia also have opportunities for on the job training at Ciboulette et Cie.</p>\n<p>The stunning photographs adorning the walls are the work of Kelly Moss Photography in Midland; the flowers are from the florist down the street, while the local print shop created the â€œStart Localâ€ t-shirts. Clearly Andre Sanche is inherently altruistic, and Midland is a community working together for the good of all, this to me, is highly commendable.</p>\n<p>As a child, Chef Andre learnt to cook at his grandmotherâ€™s side, and obtained his professional training at Algonquin College. He shared with me a cherished memory; his grandmotherâ€™s intent was to send him to Paris when he became a professional chef. While that didnâ€™t occur, she did present him with Madame Benoitâ€™s famous cook book, a treasured heirloom.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" alt="ciboulette-3" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ciboulette-3.jpg" width="588" height="310" /></p>\n<p>Chef Andre said his home garden expands seasonally, the pumpkins grown there became the pumpkin chutney on our plates, and he specializes in growing heritage vegetables.</p>\n<p>Chef Andre lives, cooks and eats with local flavour, in season he will create an ever changing array of edible treats. His food is a passion, one that he eagerly shares with his customers, students and staff.</p>\n<p>Ciboulette et Cie has tripled in size since opening; progress is now laughingly measured by the placement of his basement office, having generously yielded his space upstairs for more food related square footage. Coming soon are some amazing expansions for Ciboulette et Cie; another chef has joined the team, and an expanded menu will include more breakfast items and by fall, he hopes to open for dinner once a week.

There is also a nice patio you can choose to dine in â€“ there are half-circle booths, raised tables for bigger groups, smaller booths for couples, and cushioned wicker couches for casual encounters.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-150" alt="potted-pig-4" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/potted-pig-4.jpg" width="588" height="342" /></p>\n<p>You see Caesars and cocktails topped with olives, and sometimes you see fruit added as a finish on slushy drinks. Now, it might just be me, but I have never seen a drink topped with a strip of bacon. However, if you come to The Potted Pig you can enjoy a refreshing, strong cocktail and munch on the bacon strip resting on the rim of your glass. This is the ultimate combination for people who love to eat and drink. Looking at the drink and dinner menu, it is evident that bacon can be added to anything you can imagine.</p>\n<p>For me, The Potted Pig proved to be a particularly difficult restaurant to dine at. Bringing a vegetarian to a restaurant called â€œThe Potted Pigâ€ is probably not the best idea, but there are a few options on the menu that can be altered to accommodate a vegetarians needs. I ate the Irish Grilled Cheese &#8211; hold the bacon, please. This sandwich had beer braised onions, a smoked tomato aioli, and cheddar cheese grilled on a thick piece of bread. I also had the Prosciutto &amp; Melon Salad, but minus the prosciutto. Now, you would think that this salad would seem inadequate without the prosciutto, but it was actually quite good. It was a salad made of spinach, melons, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, all topped with a balsamic and herb vinaigrette. I went with a few carnivores so they were able to provide their experience with the bacon-filled options. One friend ordered In the Piginning, which is a ground prime rib stuffed with cheese and served on a bun filled with lettuce, tomato, and red onion with french-fries as a side. The cook puts a little scorched piggy on the top of the sandwich â€“ an appropriate finishing touch.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-149" alt="potted-pig-3" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/potted-pig-3.jpg" width="588" height="382" /></p>\n<p>There are some fairly uncommon items on this menu, with very inventive names. For instance, as an appetizer, The Potted Pig offers a Poblano Pig Popper (talk about a mouthful). This is a grilled poblano pepper wrapped in bacon and cream cheese with chive sour cream to dip. There is also a wide selection of pizza for the Italian in all of us.</p>\n<p>The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly, casual, and made light-hearted jokes with our table. The appetizers came out in good timing, while the main courses took a little longer to be prepared and served. Prices can vary depending on what you order; they are somewhat expensive, but well worth it. The portion sizes reflect the price, so you are definitely getting your moneyâ€™s worth. Sitting outside, the only thing I can recommend is to constantly be on the alert for bird droppings. Being in a prime location for birds to perch overhead, the birds will leave you a little present if youâ€™re not careful. The patio is also fairly noisy because it is located at the five-points on 10 Dunlop Street East.</p>\n<p>Overall, The Potted Pig is a fine new restaurant where you can eat like a pig and not feel guilty for it.</p>\n<p><a title="Potted Pig info." href="http://www.simcoedining.com/potted-pig" target="_blank">View Potted Pig Profile</a></p>\n<p><em>Valerie Colangelo is a writer from Barrie.

I followed the gentle scent of fresh linen, flowers and what I can only describe as â€œgood kitchenâ€. I knew then that I was about to experience a lovely dinner, every meal since has been consistently great.</p>\n<p>Flash forward to a recent <a title="Barrielicious 2013" href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrielicious-2013" target="_blank">Barrielicious</a>, when darling daughter choose Painters Hall Bistro as her summer dining treat, she with the good camera for food pictures to temp your appetite. I realize that Barrielicious is not the best time to review a restaurant; the menus are shorter, the venues are hopping, but the staff at Painters Hall juggle this summer dining frenzy with ease, the kitchen dishes out great plates, and the overall experience is as delightful as any other time I have dined there.</p>\n<p>Owner Erin Burrows shared with me that the art work lining the walls is â€œall local and revolves every six monthsâ€. Having original art on display â€œchanges the atmosphere and adds to the ambianceâ€.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-417" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/painters_MG_2093.jpg" alt="painters_MG_2093" width="588" height="350" /></p>\n<p>There are three rooms at Painters Hall Bistro, each with a distinctly different feel; the front room seems brighter and is larger, this to me is the spot for a celebratory night out, the overall volume slightly louder. The regulars gravitate to the middle room; this is where the bar is located, strong and stately, where the musicians set up on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night, where the banter is familiar between guests and staff, a sense of camaraderie is palpable. The back room has the date night feel to me, more intimate, a wee bit darker and cozier.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-419" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/painters_MG_2098.jpg" alt="painters_MG_2098" width="588" height="416" /></p>\n<p>Whichever room you choose, the service will be consistent and your dinner will be grand.</p>\n<p>Painters Hall signature menu items have stood the test of time. While there have been changes within the kitchen, the glorious Surf and Turf; â€œButter Braised Pork Belly &amp; Cider Scallopsâ€ appetizer gets a slight tweak from the Chef, and is simply divine, served with compressed Watermelon Salsa.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended"><b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title="Barrielicious 2013" href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrielicious-2013" target="_blank">Barrielicious 2013</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/north-restaurant-barrie-review">The North Restaurant</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/lunch-shirleys-bayside-grille">Lunch at Shirleyâ€™s Bayside Grille</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>My daughterâ€™s choices of; â€œPainters Hall Organic Cookstown Greens Whipped Almond Brie, Baco Noir Blueberry Vinaigrette, served on the side for her, with Crisp Asian Pear &amp; Blueberriesâ€, a perfect summer salad.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-416" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/painters_MG_2078.jpg" alt="painters_MG_2078" width="588" height="318" /></p>\n<p>In winter I always indulge in the signature main of Braised Beef Short Ribs; but for summer I chose the â€œStuffed Chicken Breast, Sweet Potato, Ricotta, Fresh Basil and Spicy Chorizo, Ontario Spring Pea Barley Risotto, Micro Green and Veg Chip Saladâ€ and was suitably pleased.

A unique solution has been offered for just this situation; â€œText the Bossâ€ cards are on hand with the phone number boldly printed, this differs from the reservation phone number and the message is clear, if you have feedback, we want to hear it. Great idea!</p>\n<p>Another unique option offered at Painters Hall Bistro is the â€œdinner meetingâ€; a three course meal is presented and A/V equipment and screens are available.</p>\n<p>I commend the originality of this working while dining experience!</p>\n<p>I asked Erin Burrows what is next for Painters Hall. With six years staying power, where does she see the restaurant going? â€œWhere do I see us going, I really listen to my regular clientele, I listen to those that dine here frequently, and I meet their expectations, everything from the wine list to new and upcoming cocktails.

Located at 147 Dunlop Street East, directly east of Fitzyâ€™s and across the street from Hooters, Manhattanâ€™s aims to please. </p>\n<p>Deciding to treat my mother and younger brother to an evening out, I thought we might test Manhattanâ€™s newly revamped menu. If you loved that Manhattanâ€™s previously had a menu largely centered on seafood, you may rest assured because the menu remains to have a plethora of seafood options available. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/manhattans-1.jpg" alt="manhattans-1" width="588" height="339" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-173" /></p>\n<p>Manhattanâ€™s continues to be a very classy, posh restaurant. Diverse paintings hung on the walls, adding a rather appropriate finish to the magenta and charcoal themed interior. The restaurant has a little patio out front where you can enjoy the open air and sun. At the opposite end of this narrow, rectangular restaurant there are grand windows that open to Barrieâ€™s beautiful waterfront view. My family and I chose to sit by the windows where we were able to enjoy the view as well as breathe in the hot summer breeze. </p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/dinner-donaleighs-irish-pub">Dinner at Donaleighâ€™s Irish Pub</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/february-blues-xvii">The February Blues XVII</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/kenzington-burger-bar">Kenzington Burger Bar</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Despite the menu being fixated on seafood, there is still a variety of items on the menu that the non-seafood lover can enjoy. If you come to Manhattanâ€™s on a Monday to Friday anywhere from 11 am until 5 pm, you can enjoy certain appetizers for $5. I enjoyed a delicious Red and Blue Salad (a small if you order off the $5 menu), which was made up of spinach, blueberries, strawberries, and pecans tossed in a blue cheese and poppy seed dressing. It was the perfect refresher for such a warm evening. Maintaining the healthy theme, my mother chose the Grilled Vegetables &#8211; white balsamic and herb grilled vegetables on spinach with a red pepper aioli. She also ordered the Sweet Chilli Chicken, which was breaded chicken breast with sesame seeds sprinkled on top of a sweet chilli sauce. She could not stop boasting about how incredible her meal was! Manhattanâ€™s is even kid friendly. My brother ordered a cheese pizza (which is made with a house tomato sauce) with French fries on the side. The childrenâ€™s menu is a main dish with a side for only $6. The exciting thing about this restaurant is that the whole family can enjoy a tasteful dinner without having to worry if everyone will be able to find something on the menu to enjoy. Manhattanâ€™s has surely covered all the bases.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/manhattans-food-1.jpg" alt="manhattans-food-1" width="588" height="239" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-172" /></p>\n<p>Manhattanâ€™s menu is quite high in price, but this is a restaurant where quality and quantity are both guaranteed. Youâ€™re paying more, so you expect to get more â€“ right? Right. The food is remarkable and the portion sizes are large. Manhattanâ€™s gives you your monies worth and makes you want to come back time and time again.  </p>\n<p>With a rather extensive drink menu, a true connoisseur of alcoholic beverages will never go thirsty here. Manhattanâ€™s has plenty of ales, cocktails, mocktails, martinis, and for the winos, a variety of white or red wines. On the weekends, Manhattanâ€™s also has live music.</p>\n<p>If youâ€™re looking to enjoy some casual drinks and some appetizers, pre-drink before a night out on the town, or have a quiet, romantic evening, Manhattanâ€™s should be your next check point.

Along the way this former rock and roll agent, promoter and manager, took a couple of side tours. He discovered he had talent creating twig furniture, and Mad Michael&#8217;s Twig Art and CafÃ© was born.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-177" alt="mad-m-6" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-m-6.jpg" width="588" height="340" /></p>\n<p>Michael does good food; this is scratch cooking at its best, everything from condiments, pickled crudities and corn bread is original. Seasonal produce is a menu staple, from the spring asparagus, early corn, or the fried green tomatoes, which are based on a recipe he discovered in a tavern in Memphis. Michael is also one of the most natural story tellers I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. His fall menu item of Caribbean fried pumpkin comes with a side serving of story.</p>\n<p>When visiting Antigua he came upon a tin shack restaurant called â€œMommaâ€™sâ€. After indulging in a beverage or two, Michael wandered around back of the shack and discovered that Momma was a hefty sized woman who hailed from Montreal, and as she cooked the pumpkin on an old electric stove, she would add a solid shake of Montreal Steak Spice to the glowing gourd.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-181" alt="mad-m-4" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-m-4.jpg" width="588" height="340" /></p>\n<p>Steak spice is the only thing Michael doesnâ€™t make himself, and that includes the kitchen proper, which is a stunning smokehouse set between the cedar trees, just out back of the dining room.

While I donâ€™t usually have dessert at lunch, the offerings were too enticing to refuse. My carrot cake was a very generous sized slice, rich, moist and covered in perfect cream cheese icing. The ice-cream a top my friends peach, mango crisp melted in delicious rivulets coating each bite to creamy goodness.</p>\n<p>There are numerous menu items I am planning on returning to try, in particular the signature skillet corn bread. Michael explained that it is made with corn flour, not corn meal, is baked fresh daily in a cast iron skillet. As Mad Michael&#8217;s closes down for the winter season, there are many regular customers, who calculate the number of weeks until spring reopening, and will order an equal amount of the famous corn bread to freeze and enjoy all winter.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-183" alt="mad-michaels-2b" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mad-michaels-2b.jpg" width="588" height="340" /></p>\n<p>I asked Michael what he would like to share with my readers and his response was immediate; when it comes to food, â€œdonâ€™t dumb downâ€ he said.

(44, 'A Trip to Chelsea Chocolates in Oro-Medonte', 'chelsea-chocolates-oro-medonte', 'http://blog.simcoedining.com/?p=184', '<p>Today my inspiration is found in a box of chocolates. The chocolates in question are nestled in a lovely gold box, they were hand formed from the finest Belgian chocolate, and they are locally produced, not 20 minutes from my home. How tasty is that?</p>\n<p>When my Editor suggested I check out Chelsea Chocolates for an interview and review, I was quite frankly, thrilled. Chocolate and I are very good friends.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chelsea-photo-1.jpg" alt="chelsea-photo-1" width="588" height="383" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-187" /></p>\n<p>My taste in chocolates is discriminating. It has to be dark chocolate and it has to be good chocolate. Chelsea Chocolates surpasses my criteria.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to meet with owner Laurie Thompson for a delightful interview and tour of her factory recently. The rich scent of chocolate met me at the door, and upon entrance, I was thrilled to be surrounded by chocolaty goodness; shelves and showcases of homemade, handmade, designer chocolates and truffles. I started to salivate.</p>\n<p>Chelsea Chocolate began locally 18 years ago, when the original owners were looking to retire, the timing proved ideal, as Laurie and her husband were also ready for a change. As she describes it, they jumped off the biggest mountain possible and bought the business. That was three years ago, and while the learning curve was steep, they have expanded their market and are deliciously pleased.</p>\n<p>Laurie previously worked in the wine business, so it was a logical transition to introduce ice-wine, spirits and liquors into their family of chocolates. Chelsea Chocolates produces ice wine chocolates for the major Ontario Wineries including; Colio, Hillebrand, Harvest, Hernder, Josephs, Konzelmann Estates, Kittling Ridge, Lailey, Legends, Peller, Peninsula Ridge, Peter Mielzyns, and Rosewood Estates. The Granite Club in Toronto is another large purchaser of Chelsea Chocolates. It is rather exciting that Simcoeâ€™s own Chelsea Chocolates travel widely around our province. Laurie explained the chocolate making process to me; I watched various steps in production, and I was thrilled to nibble samples.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chelsea-photo-2.jpg" alt="chelsea-photo-2" width="588" height="255" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-186" /></p>\n<p>All chocolate is grown along the equator, then the beans are shipped to Canada, Switzerland and Belgium. Each country has a slightly different method of manufacturing chocolate and this gives it a subtle difference, which impacts on final product. Belgian and Swiss chocolate is known worldwide to be the best quality and Chelsea Chocolate has chosen Belgian chocolate as their variety to work with. Quality is the key word here, as Chelsea Chocolates continues to work in small batch production, rolling their truffles by hand. Molds are a vital component to creating fine chocolates too, as the quality of the mold has a direct impact on the quality of the chocolate.  The best molds are made in Montreal and the UK and can vary in price from $5 to $150 for a single mold. The better the mold, the better the shine on the chocolate and that shine is another indicator of quality. Butter, cream, fresh berries and fruits boiled to a paste make the delectable cream fillings, and real mint, orange and lemon oils may also be used. Temperature is a vital component to creating good chocolate. The ideal temperature creates a â€œbite and snapâ€ reaction when one bites into a good chocolate.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chelsea-photo-4.jpg" alt="chelsea-photo-4" width="588" height="441" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-188" /></p>\n<p>I am addicted to Chelsea Chocolate; one of my personal favourites is the sweet and salty mix of a salted caramel. Numerous styles and flavours are available in milk, dark and white chocolates; truffles, butter creams, and sugar free chocolates are all offered.</p>\n<p>A very unique item Chelsea Chocolates produces is called a â€œsmash cakeâ€. This is a chocolate formed cake shaped shell, with a chocolate hammer alongside, that is to be used to â€œsmashâ€ through said chocolate shell, giving access to a delectable selection of truffles housed inside. Laurie shared how thrilled she was that Mike Holmes, he of â€œHolmes on Homesâ€ fame, was presented with a smash cake on his final day of filming a local renovation this spring. Another smash cake fan was a local bride, whose wedding was showcased on â€œFour Weddings Canadaâ€.  While flipping TV channels just last night, I serendipitously found that very show and was able to see the wedding guests delight in discovering the goodness inside. How smashing!</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chelsea-photo-3.jpg" alt="chelsea-photo-3" width="588" height="313" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-185" /></p>\n<p>Chelsea Chocolates can be purchased directly from the factory and may also be found locally at: the Royal Victoria Hospital gift shop, CafÃ© Fromagerie, Simply Tea and Chocolate and Apple Annieâ€™s in Orillia. </p>\n<p>Chelsea Chocolates<br />\n3471 Penetanguishene Rd.

I would have never thought that someone would actually create a restaurant catered to grilled cheese â€“ however, I am ever so glad that one now exists in Barrie. My family and I decided that we would see what this restaurant has to offer because we all have an insane love for grilled cheese. The restaurant is small and cosy, paneled with wood and various paintings that have grilled cheese themes.</p>\n<p>To order, you walk up to the counter at the back of the restaurant and choose from a chalkboard full of different types of grilled cheese. The Grilled Cheese Social Eatery offers a variety of combinations that I never would have thought would be good on a grilled cheese sandwich. You have to wait for your food to be cooked and brought to you, but the wait is not very long.</p>\n<p>Being gluten free, I ordered â€œThe Classic,â€ which is cheddar cheese between two slices of gluten free bread. Maybe it was the gluten free bread, maybe it was the cheddar cheese, but all I know is that this grilled cheese sandwich had me begging for more. It was so delicious! My mother tried the â€œPierogi,â€ a sandwich layered with cheddar, bacon, and caramelized onions with sour cream on the side for dipping. My brother ordered the â€œWake N Bacon,â€ which had cheddar cheese, bacon, and fried eggs loaded on gluten free bread. My brotherâ€™s girlfriend tried the â€œDill-licious,â€ a sandwich of Havarti cheese, dill, sun dried tomatoes, and caramelized onions. My family was just as pleased with their meals as I was. With every meal, there is an option of a salad or chips. We all chose salads (fresh greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes with a citrus vinaigrette as the dressing) and were perfectly satisfied. You dine out of little baskets with checkered liners and use plastic forks. I could not help but be reminded of eating at a chip truck â€“ it was such fun! This restaurant also has vegetarian and vegan options available so anyone can enjoy eating here.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/dinner-donaleighs-irish-pub">Dinner at Donaleighâ€™s Irish Pub</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/smokes-poutinerie-barrie">Smokes Poutinerie in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/mary-browns-famous-chicken-taters-barrie">Mary Brownâ€™s Famous Chicken and Taters in Barrie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-213" alt="grilled-cheese-2" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/grilled-cheese-2.jpg" width="588" height="283" /></p>\n<p>Under $10 for every option, the meal portions are fair for the price you are paying.

This recipe is a classic, fondly recreated from Jillâ€™s university years working at the Bistro Praha in Edmonton. It is real crab, not some imitation oddly coloured fish byproduct. Like every menu item on the black board at Bohemia, the first prerequisite is that the food must taste good. It is real food, as Jill would cook at home. Local and organic sourced items may be used, but Jill believes that fresh and tasty are the priority. Jill often purchases from her neighbourhood store, the Local Foods Mart, another one of my shops to stop at on a Saturday morning! </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bo-counter-inside.jpg" alt="bo-counter-inside" width="588" height="351" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-221" /></p>\n<p>Tuna used in Bohemia sandwiches is pole or line caught, this being the more sustainable and humane method.

Soups, salads, sandwiches and sweets create a solid, tasty and affordable menu.<br />\nThe eclectic dÃ©cor is part of Bohemiaâ€™s charm; With Jillâ€™s strong visual sense and fine arts degree; she oozes style and originality. An original tin ceiling, stunning second floor railing, blackboard paint signage, combined with an earthy mix of tables and chairs, exudes comfort and dissuades pretension. Local original art displays regularly appear on the walls, creating an atmosphere in keeping with the food, it too satisfies the soul.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/casa-cappuccino-barrie">A cozy and chic coffee shop in the heart of Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/soupherb-soups">SoupHerb Soups</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/savour-flavours-2014">Savour the Flavours 2014</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bo-inside-1.jpg" alt="bo-inside-1" width="588" height="221" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-219" /></p>\n<p>Favourites from her own home create the cornerstones of the menu; meat appears as an accent, and cheese is well placed in the menu items as it is a personal favourite of hers.

Dave shared that he and his mother bake these together for the restaurant, the spicing is defined but not overpowering and the pastry, simply the best I have ever had.</p>\n<p>Darling daughter ordered the crepes with ham and cheddar, a simple but tasty combination. On both plates, were servings of glazed carrots and wonderful  crisp potato croquettes. Having attempted to make crepes myself,  I have a great appreciation for these,  presented perfectly. </p>\n<p>I ended my meal with a great cup of decaffeinated coffee, and crÃ¨me brulee, while darling daughter chose the strawberry rhubarb pie, filled to bursting with fresh fruit, tucked into more of their delicious pastry. While sitting with our desserts I asked Dave Brunelle to join us, as I was eager to hear his story, and this is a man with stories to tell!</p>\n<p>The table that had been reserved for us was specifically chosen, the reason was soon to become clear. The Brunelle family has lived in Lafontaine for four generations; his grandfather was a commercial fisherman, a hunter, a farmer and a maple syrup producer, his grandmother delighted in serving large family style meals to all her beloved kin. A side room in the restaurant is dedicated to his grandmother and includes photos and memorabilia in her honour. </p>\n<p>When opening the restaurant in January 2013, Dave discovered a marvelous book, written by John Bayfield and Carole Gerow titled â€œThis Was Yesterday, a pictorial History of the early days of Penetanguisheneâ€, where it is noted that the Brunelle family can actually trace their ancestors back to the 1800â€™s as some of the earliest settlers to arrive in Penetanguishene. One of the pictures in the book shows the original main street of Penetanguishene and by turning my head just so, and  looking out the window, Dave points out to me the same street that I have just admired in an ancient photograph. I am sitting in a spot with a clear view where history of this community unfolded! </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/maitred-food-3.jpg" alt="maitred-food-3" width="588" height="207" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-229" /></p>\n<p>Apparently, the â€œFestival du Loupâ€ held every summer in Lafontaine also has a direct connection to the Brunelle family. Legend has it that a large and ferocious wolf terrified the inhabitants of this small community and it was Daveâ€™s great great uncle who in the early 1900â€™s shot the beast, which gave cause for great celebration, a tradition still honoured yearly.</p>\n<p>Dave Brunelle is a natural and gracious host; he is inspired to bring families together for meals, to provide a community restaurant where people can  enjoy the atmosphere, the history and the great food. For Thanksgiving he will be cooking and serving a family style feast for guests lucky enough to have made reservations!</p>\n<p>Le MaÃ®tre Dâ€™ is an outstanding restaurant, which has successfully combined the food of both the Metis and French Canadian cultures, this is heritage in our midst, and well worth the scenic drive to<br />\nPenetanguishene.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/le-maitre-d" title="Le Maitre D profile" target="_blank">Le MaÃ®tre Dâ€™</a><br />\n106 Main Street, Penetanguishene, ON.

Now, Donaleigh&#8217;s is not an entirely new restaurant per-say, but it was new enough to us because we had never eaten here. Walking inside, we were instantly greeted by a friendly woman clad in a kilt. We were told to choose any table of our liking so we walked to the back of the pub and sat down where it was a little less busy. We went for lunch, but because it was a nice day out the pub was rather busy â€“ both inside and on the patio. </p>\n<p>Being a hot day, the first thing that we ordered were drinks: I ordered a Somersby apple cider (my favourite summertime alcoholic beverage) and my mother chose a Vodka Cranberry Spritzer. There is a large bar directly in the middle of the pub with tons of seating around it so you can watch the game on the overhead televisions.

Feeling like indulging ourselves, we decided to would order a few appetizers to share. We asked our server for the Assorted Cheese Platter, Nachos, and Sweet Potato Fries â€“ she quickly advised us against ordering so many items because the portion sizes are very large, so we settled for Nachos and Sweet Potato Fries. I am very glad our server informed us of the portion sizes because, boy, was she not kidding! Our appetizers arrived on large platters that were loaded with food. The nachos were absolutely amazing! Instead of using typical nacho chips, this appetizer is prepared with kettle chips that we personalized to have only cheese, green onions, and black olives with salsa and sour cream on the side. The Sweet Potato Fries were delicious as well. The only concern we had was with the buttermilk dill dipping sauce that accompanies the fries â€“ personally I would have preferred a chipotle dipping sauce because I feel like it compliments Sweet Potato Fries much better. Other than the minor sauce issue, we had an absolutely amazing time dining here.

They are offering â€œfamily- sheek farm foodâ€ and yes that is how they spell it, personally I think it rids them of pretense. Barrie is enjoying the menu and everyone loves the location, situated at Bradford and Lakeshore, which offers diners a stunning view of the waterfront, especially if you are seated on the patios. This is good home style food, locally sourced and portions are very generously served.  Sunday brunch is offered, Sunday night is the roast strip loin, the Farmhouse slant on a traditional roast beef dinner.</p>\n<p>Catering is available and occasions, such as Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s Day, Thanksgiving et al are suitably recognized.</p>\n<p>The â€œHead Farmer and his Wifeâ€ wanted to cook up a casual, family friendly and budget affordable restaurant and they have achieved this goal.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/farmhouse-p3.jpg" alt="farmhouse-p3" width="588" height="313" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-241" /></p>\n<p>The menu is designed for flexibility, each entrÃ©e comes with your choice of two sides, and there is a wide selection to choose from. Carb loading, then try the mac and cheese, roasted garlic mash or the famous Feltis fries.  Perhaps it is veggie time, their zero mile, aka grown onsite salad is lovely, or brave the rapini with chilies, they were the perfect choice with my braised lamb shank. There are eleven sides to choose from! </p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/10-great-summer-grilling-cookbooks-barbecue-enthusiast">10 Great Summer Grilling Cookbooks for the Barbecue Enthusiast</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/10fold-farms-feast-summer-ciboulette-cie">10fold farms â€œFeast on Summerâ€ with Ciboulette et Cie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/chavo-crepes">Chavo Crepes in Barrie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>This is a multi-level venue, with two patios in season. The rustic charm and character has been retained from the original building, roughhewn beams frame sturdy banquets, slightly incongruent to me are the TV screens, but it works to amuse little ones and sports fans. There is a stunning bar area, well stocked of course, with a pocket friendly $12 corkage fee, as they say â€œall day, every dayâ€. I have had a number of meals at The Farmhouse; Motherâ€™s Day, a celebration with the fam jam, and a meal or two with darling daughter. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/farmhouse-p5.jpg" alt="farmhouse-p5" width="588" height="310" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-238" /></p>\n<p>A conversation with Randy about food is always delightful and informative. Our interview starts with a glass of fresh pressed beet, apple and ginger juice.  I was surprisingly impressed. I eat my beets on occasion, but drinking them, albeit knowing it is very good for me, has not been part of my dining repertoire.  I am now a convert and suggest you give the beverages a try, they are available with or without alcohol and they regularly sell out. They are made fresh and delivered directly to The Farmhouse three times a week by a local source.</p>\n<p>Randy spent time this summer as a celebrity chef spokesperson for Black and Deckerâ€™s BBQ tour, stating it was rather awe inspiring to have his face on the side of a bus!   </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/farmhouse-p4.jpg" alt="farmhouse-p4" width="588" height="261" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-239" /></p>\n<p>He returned from this summer adventure and organized a fundraising effort to provide 1200 fully loaded back packs for children in need.

The Market is going on its eigth year of business and is doing better than ever. A cute little country-esque feel to the restaurant makes you feel like you are dining in an old home out in the country. The restaurant surely has a unique set-up: the buffet reaches from one end of the restaurant to the other, with cold foods on the left, hot foods in the middle, and all the desserts you could ever hope to consume on the right. It is decorated in wood paneling from ceiling to floor, has seating everywhere you look, and hung on the walls are beautiful photographs of Barrie before commerce overwhelmed it.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/market-inside-1.jpg" alt="market-inside-1" width="588" height="333" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-244" /></p>\n<p>Being a Buffet in a growing city is quite difficult, but I believe that the Market has shown some very big progress if you had ever dined at the restaurant in its early years of business. I noticed some cards placed on the windows above the buffet where the food options were written. The Market has recently undergone some changes concerning some of the items that they purchase. Most of their produce comes from local farms around Barrie and even throughout Ontario. This is an encouraging thought because you are able to tell exactly where your food is coming from and it shows that the owners are taking an interest in their customers health.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/market-outside.jpg" alt="market-outside" width="588" height="356" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-245" /> </p>\n<p>The Market Buffet is a restaurant that offers home-style foods: roasted &#038; mashed potatoes, vegetables, fruit, pizza, tacos, soup (which is subject to change daily), pasta salads, meatloaf, potroast, wings, pasta (they have a Pasta station where you can make your own pasta on Wednesday and Saturday nights), and all you can eat steak (only Monday- Sunday for dinner). I wish I could say that this is the end of the list of options, but it&#8217;s not. The Market has &#8220;Theme Nights&#8221; throughout the week during the dinner hours: Monday is %10 Emergency Appreciation, Tuesday is half-price kids, Wednesday is Tastes of the World, Thursday is Barbeque Night, and Friday is Fish-Friday. The food options during the Lunch hour are slightly different than the Dinner menu. The night that I went there was Ratatouille (which is perfect for my vegetarian appetite), Jambalaya, and Cabbage Rolls. The Market has a rather extensive list of meal options available, it all depends on which night of the week you decide to dine there. My absolute favourite part of the Buffet was the desserts. They have these delicious little creations called Butterscotch Haystacks that were both crunchy and soft. They also have soft serve ice cream (which is a favourite of mine), and, if you ever come to the Market, please try the Brownies &#8211; you will not regret it. I do not like brownies most usually, but the Market has a special way of making you go back for seconds. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/market-inside-2.jpg" alt="market-inside-2" width="588" height="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-246" /></p>\n<p>The service seriously impressed me. You can tell that you will be well taken care of during your meal from the moment you walk into the restaurant. The cashiers are very friendly and welcoming (this is where you get your drinks and pay for your meal before you sit down to eat). The servers go out of their way to ensure that you are having an excellent experience at the Market. They take away your dirty plates (you grab a clean one everytime you go up to the buffet for more food), and refill all of your drinks. You would not think that this is a very difficult task, but when you observe the servers working they have multiple tables needing the same thing all at once so they do a lot of running. Make sure you tip your server while you are here for their good service; it is just the same as every other restaurant, and it looks like they are doing a lot more running than servers that actually take your meals. The kitchen staff is also very kind and helpful, always asking you if you are okay or if there is anything they can help you find. </p>\n<p>Pricing is fair considering it is a buffet. You can dine during the lunch hours for under $15, and during the dinner hours for less than $25 per person. This is a very affordable restaurant with a lot to offer for the price. Overall, I had a very lovely experience here &#8211; the staff made my dining experience that much more pleasant. I will surely return to dine at the Market.</p>\n<p><em>Valerie Colangelo is a writer from Barrie.

I could literally do that at Creemore Kitchen, as cozy blankets are part of the chilly seasonâ€™s dÃ©cor, and meant to be snuggled with. Creemore Kitchen serves lunch, dinner, weekend brunch and gorgeous sweets in the attached bake shop. In warmer seasons a covered patio is available.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/creemore-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="creemore-kitchen-1" width="588" height="382" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-249" /></p>\n<p>Four partners entered into this business; two are partners in life. Sam Holwell and Caesar Guinto have an eye for detail, creative skills to mix mediums, be it restaurant dÃ©cor or food on the plates. Their approach to food is in synch with my own; they support local, and have cultivated successful relationships with the farmers and growers who provide them with the fabulous raw materials from which Chef Caesar lovingly crafts the food on the menu. This is farm to table at its best.</p>\n<p>Relationships matter, community involvement is strong. On my second visit the restaurant was charmingly decorated for Halloween, with Sam and Caesar planning on hosting an open house for the neighbours, providing themed drinks for the adults, sweets for the kids, with all staff in costume. </p>\n<p>Chef Caesar is classically French trained and highly skilled at melding his many influences with the unique flavours of his Philippine background.   </p>\n<p>It is clear that extraordinary thought, planning and sourcing occurred, given the unique design items that set the stage for the comfort of guests. A gorgeous oversized chandelier centers the space, industrial style mingles with classic; tea towel napkins, index card signage, simple, classic lined notebook paper menus.  Old style glass jugs host sprays of teasel and dried seed pods, a collection of stately candlesticks stand guard on the bar, even the music fits. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/creemore-inside.jpg" alt="creemore-inside" width="588" height="388" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-251" /></p>\n<p>There is no pretense here; the design is casual elegance, which echoâ€™s the menu. </p>\n<p>Comfort food was on my mind that evening and I chose to order the â€œCrispy Pork Belly with Celery Root Puree and Apple Raisin Slawâ€ starter. Beautifully presented, the fresh crunch of the slaw balanced the smooth salty pork belly. This was flavour. I moved on to the â€œFried Chicken with Biscuit, White Thyme Gravy, Potato Puree and Carrot Slawâ€. I wanted to eat with my hands!    </p>\n<p>Dining companion du jour also stuck to the comfort food theme and ordered the burger. Her only complaint, it was so juicy, so well sized, it was a challenge to keep firmly held in her hands! For dessert, the â€œChocolate Pave with Plum Compote, CrÃ¨me Fraiche and Sableâ€, (precious rich cookies) was amazing. Table next allowed me to photograph their â€œApple Fritter with Caramel and Vanilla Ice Creamâ€, as this is a menu favourite. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/creemore-bakery-1.jpg" alt="creemore-bakery-1" width="586" height="318" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-250" /></p>\n<p>Donuts are a Saturday bakeshop feature and I suspect I will be driving forth to try some! My second trip out was for lunch and the opportunity to interview partners Sam and Caesar. I enjoyed a flavourful bowl of mushroom soup, choosing to save room for afternoon tea, having spotted in the bake shop a long time favourite, â€œNutty Meringueâ€™sâ€,  (which were previously offered at another Barrie establishment), made with Chef Caesarâ€™s recipe of course! </p>\n<p>On Chef Caesarâ€™s suggestion I took the meringue home with me, softly crumbled it, gently mixed in some organic whipped cream, and devoured it. This wonderful treat is known as â€œEton messâ€, a traditional English dessert served at Eton College&#8217;s annual cricket match. </p>\n<p>It was amazing!  </p>\n<p>So is this restaurant.</p>\n<p>I have the utmost respect for those who grow the food I eat, for those that take the raw ingredients and create tempting foods, both sweet and savory.

A man promptly came over to us and informed us we could sit anywhere in the restaurant, so we decided to choose one of the only seats that were available next to a window &#8211; or so we thought. The man that greeted us turned out to be our server, as he brought us menus and asked for our drink orders as soon as we got comfortable. Being a pub, the menu is fairly straight forward and typical of most of the pubs around Barrie. There are soups, french fries, salads, tacos, burgers, fish, wings, etc. Bourbon Street, however, has a very classy menu and offers extremely high quality food at a very decent price.</p>\n<p>We decided we could explore our surroundings while we waited for our meals, so we walked to the back of the building and we were stunned. There is a raised stage in a spacious room filled with booths, various tables, and an area in the back room with another pool table. This pub is absolutely beautiful. It has a very classy, modern design, but has pictures of the musicians of the 60&#8242;s-70&#8242;s and various guitars strung upon the walls. Once we started getting comfortable with our environment our dining experience was very pleasant.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bourbon-2.jpg" alt="bourbon-2" width="588" height="351" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-260" /></p>\n<p>Arriving at Bourbon Street for lunch, I only wanted something light so I chose a salad that had tomatoes, feta cheese, mixed greens, kalamata olives, some type of noodle or something of the sort on top, drizzled with an olive oil and vinegar dressing. My salad was a little bit too salty for my liking, but it was delicious nevertheless. My friend ordered a grilled chicken wrap with a side of French Onion soup, which was the soup of the day. She was basically drooling over how tender and well cooked the chicken was. She said it was the most fresh and tasty chicken she had eaten at a restaurant in a while.</p>\n<p>Bourbon Street is open from Monday to Sunday from 11pm until 2am and is located at 31 Bayfield Street, right in the middle of five points in downtown Barrie. Our server informed us that the pub has live music from Wednesday to Sunday, and each night has a different genre of live music.

For what the location is, it is in the perfect Barrie location. The food offering is top notch and is certainly addicting.</p>\n<p> On the down side, the restaurant is actually quite small. The Poutinerie has only about 4 tables and another handful of bar-style seats. However, because the restaurant serves mainly take-out customers, there is usually a place to sit and have a fantastic poutine. Because of the limited seating and downtown location the restaurant isnâ€™t well suited for family dining and could be troublesome for seating during a lunch-hour rush. What would work well in this setting is a date before going to a movie or out for a drink. The prices really accommodate this as well.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/smokes-seating.jpg" alt="smokes-seating" width="588" height="339" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-291" /></p>\n<p>For two poutines and two soft drinks I only paid $21.00 after tax. The poutine by itself was quite large, very filling and was a little better than your average poutine. With options like pulled pork poutine, bacon double cheeseburger poutine and Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine you get a full-fledged meal rather than just a side order.

I would not feel uncomfortable going there even late at night. The restaurants biggest selling point though is its hours of operation. The restaurant is open to 3am on Thursday nights and to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. With hours like that, when you factor in the deceased pizza place downtown, it seems as though Smokeâ€™s is an after-bar restaurant to the core.

As I walked in the door,  Danny B was in the midst of a song. That man is a charmer, he took my hand and began to serenade me, even worked my name into his song. This reviewer blushed, took a deep breath and swayed along to his fine music. Danny B, bluesman extraordinaire, got my hearty applause, my intro to the weekend  festival was off to a grand start! I stayed for a set, found our interview engaging and wished I had more time to soak up the ambiance.<br />\n<a href="http://www.dannyb.ca/index.html" title="http://www.dannyb.ca" target="_blank">http://www.dannyb.ca/index.html</a></p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/paul-james-01.jpg" alt="paul-james-01" width="588" height="337" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-297" /></p>\n<p>My next destination was Sticky Fingers. The Paul James Band was the band du jour and I was thoroughly captivated. Here is a showman, with his shock of pompadour hair, hands that magically make a beer bottle play the strings, energy personified, he had the room rocking. </p>\n<p>Paul James told me he has been playing a long time, and that he enjoys coming to Barrie for the February Blues, particularly to play for the folks that used to come down to the city to support him. It works well all round, he plays an amazing gig for us, and gets to go home to sleep in his own bed. I loved this. We get the music without the drive south, and he gets the comforts of home. </p>\n<p>I stayed long after our interview; the energy in the room reflected his, the crowd hyped to listen.  Paul James will be playing Sticky Fingers on St. Patrickâ€™s Day, Monday March 17, 2014.

Library Blues venues provided family friendly locales from Bradford to Midland during the February  Blues, allowing even the youngest fans access to the music.</p>\n<p>While Winterfest brought the crowds downtown for a perfectly chilled day of adventures, I tucked in for a cozy home afternoon, conserving my energy for another night of musical discovery.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Emily-Devlin-0973.jpg" alt="Emily-Devlin-0973" width="588" height="320" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-294" /></p>\n<p>First up Saturday eve was my new fave spot for sipping vino at their gorgeous marble bar; Cha Cha Cha Italian Restaurant. This was a new entry on the venues list, most apropos, as owner Michelle Devlinâ€™s daughter, Emily Devlin made her singing debut Saturday night, showing all present, this girl has talent! Then I was back to Sticky Fingers Bar and Grill on Bryne Drive, the headlinerâ€™s venue.</p>\n<p>While regularly providing Barrie with exceptional musical acts, this was the setting for the grand finale of weekend festivities.  In their new location, manager Dana Wright was thrilled to discover how wonderful the acoustics are; a small venue, an intimate setting, everything flows well.</p>\n<p>The staff is professional, they know their stuff.  Sticky Fingers provides consistency, serving up top notch entertainment with a side order of wings and ribs to satisfy your physical hunger, while the Blues and Jazz musicians will satisfy your every musical need.</p>\n<p><a href="http://stickyfingers.ca" title="http://stickyfingers.ca" target="_blank">http://stickyfingers.ca</a><br />\n511 Bryne Drive.

I was honoured that Rita shared her stories with me; how in 1942 she really did learn to cook on a wood burning stove in the Friuli region of northern Italy, where her family farmed. â€œWe would wait for the chicken to make the egg to make the pastaâ€, she said, explaining further that â€œwhat the land gave us was plenty, and we were luckyâ€. Rita and her family immigrated to Canada in 1953 and now many years and many stoves later, she still creates the pasta her family and yours can enjoy, or as they say â€œMamma took the time so you donâ€™t have toâ€.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended"><b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/pizzeria-italia-downtown-barrie-mulcaster">Pizzeria Italia in downtown Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrie-farmers-market">Barrie Farmers Market</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/cafe-fromagerie" target="_blank">A trip to CafÃ© Fromagerie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>For twenty years Rita cooked for the family restaurant â€œLuigiâ€™s Pizzaâ€œ, on highway 11 south of Gravenhurst, in Muskoka. When she retired, Rita kept cooking vast amounts, and her family realized they simply couldnâ€™t keep eating like that. Rita was content to cook, it kept her from becoming bored, her family thought perhaps she could share her talents with others, and the decision was made to open a low key hobby business for her. The commercial kitchen was built in the basement of her home, and â€œMamma Rosaâ€™s Food began.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-303" alt="mamma-rosa-food-2" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mamma-rosa-food-2.jpg" width="588" height="360" /></p>\n<p>Small batch, labour intensive, traditional recipes are used to create the exquisite lasagnas, both meat and vegetable, spinach ricotta cannelloni, hearty shepherds pie and meat pies, meatballs with sauce, hot pepper jelly and jars of wonderful homemade tomato sauce are also available.</p>\n<p>This is a multi-generation family owned and operated business. All food is locally made from scratch in the traditional manner. No motorized pasta machine for Mamma Rosa, she turns the handle, feeds the dough through the machine as it becomes thin to translucency. I found it quite fascinating to watch. Rita and her son Dave had generously agreed to create a batch of pasta specifically for me to take photos of, and all the while a large pot of sauce simmered, the tempting scents wafted about the room. This is really good pasta; a tasting last summer held at the Rosseu General Store had a customer declare it to be â€œthe perfect blend of simple ingredientsâ€.</p>\n<p>I concur.</p>\n<p>For our Sunday dinner I baked a cannelloni and a meat lasagna. Do follow the instructions; the pasta needs to be cooked until the sauce well is absorbed. I invited a friend to join darling daughter and I for dinner; I made a side salad, warmed some fresh crusty Italian bread and we proclaimed it a feast. Five layers of pasta, each with heaps of mozzarella, a blend of meats, plenty of that tasty sauce; the combination of mild, delicate flavours, just beautiful!</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-306" alt="mamma-rosa-food-1" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mamma-rosa-food-1.jpg" width="588" height="400" /></p>\n<p>Rita, a sincere thank you for allowing me to come into your home to witness your humble and extraordinary talent in the kitchen.

Well dear readers, magic happens.</p>\n<p>This is a review about collaboration in its finest form.</p>\n<p>Collaboration by definition is simply working jointly together.

Ms. Hunt felt that this diversity would make an interesting format for a series of talks. Her colleagues agreed. Stepping out of the classrooms, they choose to share their talents and interests with the community by means of a themed series of lectures. The first of the series was held in the fall of 2013, entitled â€œFood for Thoughtâ€, the second theme, presently offered is â€œThink About Drinkâ€.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-313" alt="createispace-1" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/createispace-1.jpg" width="588" height="295" /></p>\n<p>The Creative Space is the location, the ideal space, a perfect collaborative environment to bring together the speakers and the audience in our downtown core.</p>\n<p>Chad Ballantyne created the co-working community that is The Creative Space, giving freelancers, startups and micro-businesses the opportunity to work and collaborate in an innovative, creative community focused space. It is a glorious space. By day filled with desks, the walls an ever changing myriad of local art work.</p>\n<p>â€œThe Moralsâ€ practice in the basement space, lending a melodic backdrop to evening events. With a committed community focus, the space is available for social agencies or charity groups at a reasonable rental rate. This is a feel good locale that walks the walk, be it for social or environmental responsibility, education and mentorship focus or historical and cultural leanings, all of which matter deeply and as such, are carved in their code of ethics.</p>\n<p>It just feels good in this place, which I strongly suspect enhances the work done by those that call The Creative Space their workplace home.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-314" alt="food-2" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/food-2.jpg" width="588" height="217" /></p>\n<p>Enter Cravings; the final component to the lecture series, the piece de resistance, the edible factor. When Laurentian University approached Cravings to cater â€œFood for Thoughtâ€, suggesting that perhaps fruit and cheese plates with some coffee for a beverage would be hospitable offerings, Cravings Fine Food Market &amp; Catering, well versed in events, knew they could make the comestibles far more interesting. They did this by working with the lecture seriesâ€™ specific themes to develop a tasting menu that genuinely supported each evenings event.</p>\n<p>As one who attended all the â€œFood for Thoughtâ€œ lectures and now looks forward to the Wednesday nights of â€œThink About Drinkâ€, I can attest that Cravings does their culinary research and treats us to an amazing array of nibbles, amuse bouche, mini mains, sweets and drinks.</p>\n<p>Cravingâ€™s is Angela Pidutti and her partner in life and business, Craig Russel. Angela grew up in Sudbury and as such her affiliation to Laurentian University is far reaching. For Angela this is working with a piece of home.</p>\n<p>Growing up, home was a family that knew real food, good food, a family of entrepreneurs who held full and busy lives, they found family time together sharing a meal.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/radio-cafe-maclaren-art-centre">Radio CafÃ© at the MacLaren Art Centre</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/10fold-farms-feast-summer-ciboulette-cie">10fold farms â€œFeast on Summerâ€ with Ciboulette et Cie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/farmhouse-barrie">The Farmhouse in Barrie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Cravings reflects this in their philosophy.

It is a joy to see how easily the ideas flow.</p>\n<p>The focus is on providing very good food, be it at the store or any event they cater; catering is their specialty. The hot table is impressive; stocked daily with an amazing selection of lunch and dinner items, sides, and mains, fabulous panini sandwiches and the best salmon salad I have ever had.</p>\n<p>In store they also sell products from local suppliers which complement their items.

Shared values, commitment to social good, bringing together their best to our community, as Jennifer Allen said when speaking about the collaboration with The Creative Space and Laurentian Lecture series, â€œyou would pick them as a partner in gym class, you just know you would play well togetherâ€.

With the side of rice, either sticky or steamed, the dish was overall very filling and I was quite content to leave with leftovers. For the same price the Garlic Chicken had a mixture of snow peas and broccoli, and had a slightly sweeter garlic sauce which was also quite nice. By comparison, the sticky and steamed rice were equally good, and there were also some fried rice main courses to try.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Chicken-Skewers.jpg" alt="Chicken-Skewers" width="588" height="260" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-318" /></p>\n<p>Although the two main dishes I had a chance to try were not the most expensive on the menu, at $9.99 it seemed like a nice value on this dining experience. Some dishes were upwards of $14.00 if I remember correctly. I should also note that as an option, I could have had my dish either mild, medium or hot. The last time I went to a Thai restaurant, it was in hopes of finding the spiciest sauce ever. Iâ€™m sure if thatâ€™s what you were looking for, the hotter offerings might suit your fancy quite nicely. Iâ€™m sure you may even be able to get them to whip up something even spicier, but I could be wrong. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/calamari.jpg" alt="calamari" width="588" height="271" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-319" /></p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/rawlicious-barrie">Rawlicious in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/review-spice-indian-wine-bar-barrie">SPICE Indian Cuisine and Wine Bar in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barries-bohemia">Barrieâ€™s Bohemia</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>There were so many order possibilities to choose from at Royal Thai Cuisine.

With a location in the same parking lot as the Value Village, and No Frills on Wellington St in Barrie, Mary Brownâ€™s should do fine, but itâ€™s not the same as having a restaurant in the Georgian Mall or beside a Walmart.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-330" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/seating.jpg" alt="seating" width="588" height="331" /></p>\n<p>The restaurant itself was very pleasing to eat in. Everything was cleaned very well, and sometimes the staff was cleaning up the tables immediately after customers leaved. I guess if you go you can be sure there will be a spot for you and/or your group. As well as the high standard of cleanliness, the restaurant still had that typical â€œnew chicken jointâ€ feel to it. I do like getting in on the action before a fast food place turns into a worked in machine like most Tim Hortonâ€™s franchises in Barrie have become. Not to say itâ€™s a bad thing but the newness is apparent still.</p>\n<p>But, Iâ€™m going to say that for most customers, Mary Brownâ€™s is going to be a takeout joint and it was apparent as we sat and waited for out orders. I can say that the lineup was surprisingly long at times, considering it was only 3PM on a Saturday. I guess I was surprised that people had already jumped on the Mary Brownâ€™s bandwagon in just a few months of existence. After eating the food I realized why.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-329" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/feast.jpg" alt="feast" width="588" height="367" /></p>\n<p>A lot of times I go out specifically for taters and I can say the Mary Brownâ€™s taters are easily the best Iâ€™ve had. They make their taters very crispy, with just the right type of salt and spice to them. Most places Iâ€™ve went to for taters, they were either kind of soggy or blandly spiced or over cooked so they tasted dry. This wasnâ€™t the case at Mary Brownâ€™s. The taters alone are worth returning for. About the fried chicken though, I can say itâ€™s not quite as greasy as KFC or Popeyeâ€™s but has a wonderful seasoned flavour and succulence. I admit, itâ€™s not the greatest food for your health but sometimes fried chicken just hits the spot.</p>\n<p>Other things on the menu include: chicken sandwiches, wings, wraps, chicken fingers, pulled chicken sandwiches. All meal combinations come with either macaroni salad or coleslaw.</p>\n<p>The price at Mary Brownâ€™s was fair, and what I absolutely thought was a steal was the medium taters, which I specifically went back for after having a traditional chicken meal. The medium taters was quite large (chip stand sized) and only cost $6.00. But I have to say, for the quality of chicken, and because Iâ€™m used to the quality at KFC, the prices at Mary Brownâ€™s are entirely reasonable, and worth switching for, if you live in Barrie.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-331" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/front.jpg" alt="front" width="588" height="345" /></p>\n<p>All in all, Iâ€™m glad I tried Mary Brownâ€™s. I donâ€™t often eat fried chicken but if I had the urge again, Mary Brownâ€™s would be the best choice. However, because the taters were so good, and I get my groceries from that No Frills, Iâ€™ll probably pick up the taters while Iâ€™m there.</p>\n<p>Written By: Michael Whone</p>\n<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Follow Michael Whone on TwitterÂ </span><a style="color: #000000;" title="@whoneranger" href="http://twitter.com/whoneranger" target="_blank">@whoneranger</a></em></p>\n', 'Mary Brownâ€™s Famous Chicken and Taters is a new restaurant to Barrie.

They do have a nice variety of sweet squares, tarts and cakes to hit your sweet spot.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/casa-cappuccino-barrie">A cozy and chic coffee shop in the heart of Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/flying-monkeys-brewery-barrie">Flying Monkeys Brewery</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/smokes-poutinerie-barrie">Smokes Poutinerie in Barrie</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>For the most part, a seemingly regular bunch of patrons are coming to Pair-A-Dice, bringing newcomers more and more are there for the vast selection of board games. But patrons go for the games. They have a broad selection of classics like Monopoly, The Game of Life, Battleships, Jenga or Clue. Titles like this could never be wrong. Iâ€™d like to bring a larger party and play a long game of Risk at least once.

A popular game now-a-days (even played on the sitcom Big Bang Theory) is Settlers of Catan. Pair-A-Dice has it as well as a number of its Expansion sets. One of my favourites is a more complex game called Power Grid. And the last time I visited, one of the friendly waiter taught me and a friend how to play a crazy, awesome card game called Smash Up. Iâ€™m glad I tried it. It was so fun that we ended up playing for a 3 hour run.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pairadice-gamers.jpg" alt="pairadice-gamers" width="588" height="336" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-359" /></p>\n<p>Iâ€™m just thinking ahead to the winter time when itâ€™s much better to be indoors than out in some blizzard. Pair-A-Dice is going to be an excellent winter getaway. It would be perfect after a hockey game, or after hitting the slopes; just an exciting game and a hot chocolate. Or even for an entire day of games on the weekend. You wonâ€™t end up spending too much money, and the fun will surely be through the roof (as they say). The hours of the cafÃ© at 12PM â€“ 12AM, so you can surely get gaming there pretty late too.</p>\n<p>Now that the South End of Barrie has become a bit of a recent retail hotspot, the location at 31 Commerce Park Drive has a variety of benefits.

There was a smoked salmon dish and a large selection of salads to fill out the lunch menu.  </p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended"><b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/pizzeria-italia-downtown-barrie-mulcaster">Pizzeria Italia in downtown Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/pumpkinpalooza-barrie">Pumpkinpalooza in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/painters-hall-bistro" target="_blank">Painters Hall Bistro</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>To me, I much preferred the Caesar salad that came with both the baked chicken wrap and grilled sirloin steak.  The quality of salad was far superior to many Caesar salads I&#8217;ve tried at large chain restaurants.  The dressing was delicious and the large chunks of bacon really made these two dishes come alive.  You just donâ€™t get quality like that at a sub shop or on the giant salad bowls you get at East Side Marioâ€™s.  As a side-note, The Eggless Caesar Salad at Shirleyâ€™s is priced at $11.00.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/shirleys-steak.jpg" alt="shirleys-steak" width="588" height="465" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-386" /></p>\n<p>Iâ€™m very glad I tried the Sirloin 6oz. Steak.  It was priced at $15.00 and was the most expensive dish we tried.  It came with grilled mushrooms and caramelized onions which were a very tasty addition.  I really love going to a place like Shirley for a change, because Iâ€™m always afraid of the prices, but in reality Shirleyâ€™s Bayside Grille is a nicer place to spend your afternoon than any of the in and out sandwich shops but really has prices that are about equal anyway.  If youâ€™re with a group, the variety on the menu just adds to its appeal.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/shirleys-bar.jpg" alt="shirleys-bar" width="588" height="421" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-388" /></p>\n<p>The atmosphere and service at Shirleyâ€™s was as expected.  The waitresses were friendly, the food came quick and cooked perfectly.  The music weather and tables were all great too.  I can see why Shirleyâ€™s has been in that spot along Dunlop Street for over 15 years.  It was very busy inside the restaurant as well.  If anything, the interior eating area seemed like a nicer atmosphere than the patio.  But I guess Iâ€™ll have to try the main seating area for dinner one night.  Also, Shirleyâ€™s Bayside Grille is featuring live music on Wednesday nights if youâ€™re looking to go out for a relaxing and lounge-like setting sometime.  I donâ€™t think it gets as rowdy as some of the bars and pubs the rest of downtown Barrie has to offer, but I canâ€™t say for sure.  Check it out!

They were alongside Marco Ormonde from The North offering diners classic Whiskey Sours, traditionally made with Crown Royal, fresh lime juice, simple syrup, egg whites and bitters. The attention to detail for a drink is unusual for a bar, but quality matters and they know it. The drinks were fabulous and I decided then and there, drinks and dinner at Kenzington was in order.</p>\n<p>I rolled in first one Saturday night with a gal pal; we took our seats at the bar, this being one good looking, fully stocked, back lit, bar that serves up classic fresh made cocktails. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ken-bartender_MG_9987.jpg" alt="ken-bartender_MG_9987" width="588" height="446" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-392" /></p>\n<p>We ordered our drinks and settled in with spinach dip for snacking, having observed the size of the loaded nachos and realizing it was far beyond the size of our appetites. </p>\n<p>I donâ€™t usually recommend drinks, but I canâ€™t say enough about the cocktails shaken and stirred at Kenzington.  The talented bartenders are mixing up classic signature cocktails, using fresh ingredients. Fresh makes the difference be it at the bar or in the kitchen, as Neil Ornella tells me â€œwe use fresh squeezed lime juice vs bar lime, we do it properlyâ€.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ken-inside-MG_0008.jpg" alt="ken-inside-MG_0008" width="588" height="415" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-393" /></p>\n<p>The bar also houses the mighty iMac, with a playlist I would like to have. The music is the perfect accompaniment, it keeps the room humming until the live band starts. </p>\n<p>Neil Ornella told me during our interview that he is responsible for the bar music, which is a compilation gleaned from their own playlists, carefully blended to suit the mood of the days. If itâ€™s Saturday afternoon; it is going to be Blues and Rock, Stones and Faces, Led Zeppelin with a side order of Motown. Very tasty!  </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ken-patio1.jpg" alt="ken-patio1" width="588" height="294" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-396" /></p>\n<p>Neil apparently takes to the stage to play music too and I am marking my calendar for the annual â€œThose Guys Christmas Spectacularâ€.</p>\n<p>I returned to the Kenzington with an appetite to try the namesake burgers; taking two hungry teens with me.  A first for me was the bartenderâ€™s creation of a namesake cocktail; the â€œPenelopeâ€ was to my liking, Grey Goose based, magic in a glass with a hint of lime, it had my taste buds primed for the main event. The menu is ably explained; step one, pick your style of burger, step two, pick your bun, gluten free options are available, step three, pick your meat, beef, chicken, turkey or  veggie,  step four, choose your side, perhaps youâ€™re in a mood for fries or rings, or green it up with a salad. </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ken-food1_MG_9997.jpg" alt="ken-food1_MG_9997" width="588" height="392" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-395" /></p>\n<p>There are suggested favourites too; I went with the â€œBlack &#038; Blueâ€, Blue cheese, blackened spice and baconâ€, on a Brioche Bun. The â€œCalifornianâ€ is a popular choice; avocado, Monterey Jack, bacon and chipotle mayo. Feeling â€œCrazyâ€? That menu item requires 24 hoursâ€™ notice and includes 1 lb. of beef! For non-burger fans there are numerous poultry options, veggie wraps and the Canadian tradition of Poutine also appears in a plethora of incarnations. We three were pleased with our burgers and sides. The kitchen is small, so sip your beverages slowly, staff are upfront about this and your burger is worth the wait. As they say, this is â€œsimple food, done properlyâ€.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ken-sign_MG_0003.jpg" alt="ken-sign_MG_0003" width="588" height="421" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-397" /></p>\n<p>Timing and longevity are partners for Brandon Clark; Kenzington has been a fixture on Dunlop Street for seven years now and we can expect to see cross branding with his purchase of Tropical North next store. This partnership is hot, bringing watersports and SUP rentals to the waterfront and these sports enthusiasts will logically bring their appetites to Kenzington Burger Bar.</p>\n<p>Another appetite enticing option is for the Kenzington Food truck to come to you! What a great way to bring flavour and party atmosphere to your wedding or family celebration. </p>\n<p>I wonder if it comes with the same great sound track.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/flying-monkeys-brewery-barrie">Flying Monkeys Brewery</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrie-jazz-blues-festival-2014">Barrie Jazz and Blues Festival XIX</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/dinner-donaleighs-irish-pub">Dinner at Donaleighâ€™s Irish Pub</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Neil Ornella captured the essence of Kenzington when he said; â€œItâ€™s a true testament to the bar, and all the integral components of what make it a successful business to have an independent restaurant, especially in downtown Barrie  be a staple, and be a staple for as long as it has been and continue to be.

This is the 4th year for the market, which started as a pilot project for the Town of Innisfil under their Inspiring Innisfil 2020 forecast.  Rob Radcliffe is the Chair this year, and with an ever growing roster of vendors, Georgian Hills Vineyard about to join in with their VQA wines, this is a great place to shop! Weekly entertainment is provided. Special events are held, from strawberries to BBQâ€™s, corn roast to apples, a celebration of the fall harvest with a pumpkin festival in the fall.  The market has a friendly energy you can feel, cheerful balloons and signage help showcase the vendor of the week.</p>\n<p>I found Hollyâ€™s Sweets &#038; Eats, which I consider hands down Barrieâ€™s best bakery side-by-side the family owned Ficklewood Farm. We tried their pork sausage on a bun with onions and red peppers and tasted their pulled pork; both are nicely seasoned, very tasty indeed. I purchased an amazing cheese, caramelized onion and bacon bread, which made fabulous BLT sandwiches for lunch on the weekend!</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/savour-flavours-2014">Savour the Flavours 2014</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/local-foods-mart-barrie">Local Foods Mart in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrie-farmers-market">Barrie Farmers Market</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>I sampled some delightful maple products from Everything Maple and More, and learnt they had been on Dragons Den pitching their wares.<br />\nA flower booth was blooming lovely, Cookstown greens; known for their outstanding produce had baskets of bounty.

As market manager Anne Lesperance shared with me, customers tell her â€œThis feels like a good place for a Farmersâ€™ Market to beâ€. </p>\n<p>I happened to attend on Strawberries and Cream event day and was duly impressed. This was a joint fundraiser for the market and The Sharing Place Food Bank in Orillia. Kawartha Dairy donated the ice cream and the monies raised were split between the food bank and the farmerâ€™s market. The market portion will go toward the building fund as a contribution to their winter home. Anne Lesperance explained that with new refrigeration units at the food bank,  they are now able to accept fresh produce from vendors at both Orillia Farmers markets. Vendors are able to donate to the Sharing place, which means that members of the community in need, are able to access fresh produce. </p>\n<p>Local altruism in action!</p>\n<p>A unique find I discovered at the market was a mobile wood burning oven.  I was familiar with some of the vendors as they are also at â€œmyâ€ home market in Barrie. It was good to see McBrideâ€™s Organics and Black Angus Farm Gate and to meet new vendors, Just Say Cheese and Franni Granola amongst many others.  I found Simply Tea and Chocolate situated here, having known them from a Barrie locale too! </p>\n<p>The market has a wide variety of unique events scheduled for the season, including a Buskerfest, Medieval Festival, College /University Student Scavenger Hunt, Three Sisters Celebration and more.</p>\n<p>As they say â€œthey make it, bake it or grow itâ€, go check it out!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.orilliafairgroundsfarmersmarket.ca/" target="_blank">www.orilliafairgroundsfarmersmarket.ca</a></p>\n<p>Orillia Farmers Market- Downtown is the oldest business in town; literally, dating back to 1842, so their motto â€œGet your boots to the rootsâ€ is absolutely apropos!  </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/downtown_MG_2009.jpg" alt="downtown_MG_2009" width="588" height="370" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-406" /></p>\n<p>Changes have taken place, but now that the downtown market is firmly grounded at the library the tradition of bringing farm fresh foods continues. From the oldest to the newest, trend setting food vendors are making this a niche market and food folk are rejoicing. The market has booths from two local restaurants that base their menus on locally grown foods sourced from the farmers market. Yummy and reasonably priced breakfasts are available for the early risers from Bistro 179 and Tre Sorelle, known for their Italian specialty items are regulars. My taste buds were thrilled to eat at Fox Foods, their tacos and â€œfoxsiclesâ€ have me craving more. Thankfully they are opening a resto this fall in Orillia. Oh Editor take note, I am going back!  Midlandâ€™s Grounded Coffee has a booth here; theirs is the daily brew in my home. It was great to see the Pretzel People again too!

In the summer the patio is absolutely fantastic; itâ€™s in fact probably one of the largest Iâ€™ve seen downtown. Because the restaurant is a little nestled from the busy Dunlop street, the restaurant affords you to have a very easygoing and quiet lunch or dinner on the patio. </p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended"><b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barries-royal-thai-cuisine">Barrieâ€™s Royal Thai Cuisine</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/market-buffet-grill-barrie">The Market Buffet and Grill in Barrie</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/mayors-brunch-levee" target="_blank">Mayors New Years Brunch and Levee</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>The food at Chaopaya is very exciting, tasty and very affordable too. They offer main course dishes ranging from the $10 mark up to around $16 for the duck stir-fry. I was able to try two Thai curry dishes and a very generic chicken stir-fry meal. Both curries were very flavourful, not too spicy and quite filling. </p>\n<p>Even though the curry is considered to be medium spice level, the servers let us know that they can be made hot or very hot. Iâ€™ve been to a few Thai restaurants and the medium spice was perfect for me. Thai curry isnâ€™t much like its Indian counterpart; it tends to be lighter and oily as opposed to a thick and pasty Indian curry. Either way it makes for a lighter healthy dish that tastes great. Both the Red Beef Curry and Green Chicken curry are made with a coconut curry sauce.	</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cthai-redcurrybeef.jpg" alt="cthai-redcurrybeef" width="588" height="504" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-424" /></p>\n<p>The Chicken with mixed vegetables came with broccoli, bamboo and carrots, as did most of the other meals. However some of the other dishes were a little different like the Golden Curry Chicken and Tamarind Curry Beef with potatoes or the Chicken with Peanut Sauce with peppers and onions. </p>\n<p>Sadly, I did not try the Duck with Ginger which is one of the most expensive dishes on the menu but looks absolutely fantastic. Most dishes are served with rice making the overall bill very affordable. But whatâ€™s more, if you go there for lunch, many of the main course meals are offered at a reduced lunchtime price of $9.95. The lunch dishes are also served with a small hot and sour soup and spring roll as an appetizer. Itâ€™s quite a deal. </p>\n<p>As far as Thai restaurants in downtown Barrie, Chaopaya is easily the best value for your money, and the food is just great and the atmosphere is very charming. If youâ€™re looking for a quick, light and healthy lunch option, Chaopaya might be a little bit away from the main part of downtown but itâ€™s worth trying. Dinner at Chaopaya is also great and even checking out the patio for afternoon drinks with a few friends would be quite relaxing as well. Itâ€™s a very nice spot. I liked it, and for now, itâ€™s my go to place for Thai food in Barrie.

Nathan often develops the menu and cooks the feasts that he and Melissa will serve, but on this evening, Chef AndrÃ© Sanche, decided to â€œcome out and playâ€. Chef AndrÃ© was the inaugural chef for their â€œfeastsâ€ and the three work well together. For the â€œFeast on Summerâ€, Nathan led the guests on a tour of the farm before dinner; a wonderful walking aperitif. This stimulated conversation, educated us to their farming principals and allowed ample time for photography.</p>\n<p>As gloaming settled, candlelight welcomed us to the table and the feast began.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-433" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_9536-1.jpg" alt="_MG_9536-(1)" width="588" height="392" /></p>\n<p>Dinner was divine; we started with a small glass of craft beer, with our 1st; Sticky Portuguese Style Berkshire Braised Pork Belly on onion and roasted garlic compote with sautÃ©ed sweet peppers.

Guests lingered near the bonfire as the embers waned, it was hard to say goodnight. Feasts are offered throughout the season, each has its own theme, details are sent out to those on the email list.

The Berkshire pork is available to purchase at Ciboulette et Cie and is the pork of choice for Chef AndrÃ© in his restaurant. Nearing Christmas, 10fold farms will have their mushroom logs available for purchase at Ciboulette et Cie. These spore injected logs make great gifts; we purchased one last year and my young nephew found the sprouting fungi enchanting.</p>\n<p>Chef AndrÃ© Sanche has been featured previously on Simcoe Dining; I was privileged to experience his talents at the <a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/9th-annual-chef-wine-series-2013-georgian-dining-room">Georgian College Chef Series</a>, and I reviewed his restaurant, <a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/ciboulette-cie-midland">Ciboulette et Cie</a> in June 2013. Growth and accolades continue for Chef AndrÃ© Sanche; the restaurant has acquired a liquor license andÂ is now open for Thursday night dinners, with a communal flair. Ciboulette et Cie has been designated a â€œFEAST ONâ€ Member with the Ontario Culinary Tourism Alliance. This prestigious honour recognizes a minimum use of 25% local foods, and a gorgeous wooden spoon is presented to members!</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-437" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_9603.jpg" alt="_MG_9603" width="588" height="392" /></p>\n<p>10fold farms flourishes; this has been the first year they had a booth at the Orillia Farmers Market and they will be there until Christmas; selling their frozen pork products and a plethora of seasonal delights all grown and baked fresh on the farm. Jams and jellies, hand pies in seasonal flavours; rhubarb, strawberry and soon to arrive will be apple. They sell pulled pork sandwiches on homemade bread each week, jars of lard they have rendered themselves for your own baking, and some amazing flavoured and herbed butters made in collaboration with Stirling Creamery, barrel churned butter.

For thirty years the responsibilities of career and family took priority, but his dream didnâ€™t fade. In February 2014, Violetâ€™s Venue, a â€œpurple hued no expense spared temple to the Bluesâ€, opened its doors in Barrie, thus fulfilling Bruceâ€™s long held dream while setting the stage to leave a musical legacy for his young daughter Violet.</p>\n<p>Violetâ€™s Venue provides concert goers from near and far with an exclusive, very intimate concert experience. Seating is for 92 patrons, every seat is a great one.</p>\n<p>For those that require it, an elevator is available. Merch table, meet and greet with autograph session are part and parcel of the evenings, a fans dream! Beverages both alcoholic and non are available. Facilities on the main floor avail themselves for foodie events.</p>\n<p>A historic organ, the type traditionally played by Blues musicians, bronze plaque polished, gleaned from a Toronto church, is right of stage and the entire sound system, well, it is astounding! Which brings me to the music, and at Violetâ€™s Venue, it is all about the music.</p>\n<p>Mid set; I was honoured to be granted an exclusive interview with Tom Wilson, of Juno Award winning, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-443" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/violets-tom-wilson.jpg" alt="violets-tom-wilson" width="588" height="392" /></p>\n<p>Penelope Morrow: I usually interview Chefs, so canâ€™t help but bring a comparison to food; too many cooks can spoil the broth, but NOT with you guys. You have a stellar musical career happening, all of you, and extraordinary talents.</p>\n<p>How do you identify what song is going to be your song and what song is going to be a Blackie and the Rodeo Kings song? How do you choose?</p>\n<p>Tom Wilson: You know what, there is some kind of thing that comes out of the cosmos, some kind of magic trick, or some kind of spiritual guide. Letâ€™s call it for lack of a better term, thereâ€™s a spiritual guide that comes out of the creative energy you know, something we do pool from other worlds, and you follow that lead. That you go with creatively so you actually know whatâ€™s right and after doing this for so long we donâ€™t try to do things we shouldnâ€™t be doing, we donâ€™t try and force things, on one another or on ourselves or try to put the round peg into the square hole kind of thing.</p>\n<p>PM: What is your BARK method as it were, for reconciling with strong personalities both musical and personal, and dealing with the distance between your locales? Youâ€™re in Hamilton, Colin is in Nashville and Stephen is in Halifax. How do you have such a cohesive band when you are so far apart?</p>\n<p>TW: I think it probably helps a little bit, we donâ€™t get under each otherâ€™s skin, we donâ€™t see a lot of each other except, unless, we have the intent of doing something creatively, it defines our relationships at this point in our lives. I have known Colin since I was 16 years old; I have known Stephen since aboutÂ 1994, about 21 years I guess. So familiarity builds contempt and there is just none of that in this band. Also we have built a band that doesnâ€™t say no to one another we are open to ideas all the time, because we are able to trust one another that the person is not going to lead us down a path we shouldnâ€™t beÂ going down so not having to say no is easy.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-448" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/violet-stephen-1.jpg" alt="violet-stephen-1" width="588" height="308" /></p>\n<p>PM: You are touring North and South, had to use that one, you are even going to the Calabogie Road.</p>\n<p>TW: Yah we kind of go from one project to another. Colin is about the one guy that is the most stable at home these days as he works in Nashville. He is a go to guy as a guitar player and as a writer and as a producer, he is working on a TV show called Nashville full time, he is on the show, he is part of the musical direction of the show, recording team, its huge, the show is huge, nice little gig to be working on. Itâ€™s also a great creative outlet for him, but also its keeping him at home. And every once and a while, I am 55 and tired of travelling, so you always look for ways to be able to, that allow you to choose what you want to do when you want to do it cause thatâ€™s what becoming an artist is all about.</p>\n<p>Basically itâ€™s impossible for us to be told what to do. For whatever reasons we are born with authority issues and now we are middle aged men with authority issues, so itâ€™s even more difficult for us to be told what to do. Sustaining a life where you get to be creative and you get to make choices that you get to live with, that you donâ€™t have to live by anyone elseâ€™s choices for you, thatâ€™s important and thatâ€™s what we will continue to try and do until they are throwing dirt on our caskets.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-444" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/violets-band_MG_9276-2.jpg" alt="violets-band_MG_9276-2" width="588" height="281" /></p>\n<p>PM: Do you like the small venues?</p>\n<p>TW: Sure I like any venue. This is a great place. I like any place, I like it here. This is nice, I donâ€™t know what it was, it looks like it might have been a funeral home or a banquet hall maybe.</p>\n<p>PM: I believe it was a banquet hall.</p>\n<p>TW: Most of all itâ€™s about the heart that people put in the venue. Bruce, who owns it, he puts a lot of heart into this place and heâ€™s got a real love for music and thatâ€™s what we need. We need more of that.</p>\n<p>PM: I agree!</p>\n<p>PM: Tell me about your painting?</p>\n<p>TW: Yet another vehicle for the life I choose to live, the creative life I chose to live. I started painting in 1997, because I wanted to stop being destructive, and I wanted to be productive, and it was a great<br />\noutlet.</p>\n<p>PM: Thank you so much for your time.</p>\n<p>TW: Thank you very much, itâ€™s good.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-449" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/colin_MG_9129-2.jpg" alt="colin_MG_9129-2" width="588" height="517" /></p>\n<p>Blackie and the Rodeo Kings performed an amazing show at Violetâ€™s Venue on November 10, 2014. Colin Linden, Stephen Fearing and Tom Wilson engage the audience with their thoughtful wit and storytelling between songs. The caliber of their songwriting impresses me, rich with life experience and depth of emotion, with guitars in hand they lead us, they make my boots stomp and my hips sway.

Honey and maple syrup is available to purchase in store, as are some glorious Group of Seven mugs, homage apparent for all things Canadiana. Also available seasonally are freshly made compound butters, which have adorned the corn on the cob at the Mariposa Festival for many years. They are made in house with Kawartha Dairy butter, in flavours as diverse as dill pickle, brown sugar wild blueberry, maple chipotle, and garlic ProvenÃ§al.</p>\n<p>I was delighted to celebrate my birthday dinner at Era 67, even more so when I discovered a charming personalized birthday card nestled next to the fresh flowers on the table. This is good customer service. Gordon Lightfoot tunes played in the background, the soundtrack epitomizes Canadian music.

Darling daughter dined on the Local Tre Sorelle handmade pasta stuffed with Era 67 Wild Mushroom duxelle, Chardonnay reduction, shallots, thyme, Woolrich goat cheese, Balderson aged cheddar, tossed with a roasted garlic cream sauce and topped with wilted baby arugula, grape tomatoes in maple marinara.</p>\n<p>With friends and a birthday cake waiting for me at home, I was still tempted to try a wee dessert. Once again the serversâ€™ choice was correct. â€œSweet Poutineâ€ was light as air, â€œCrispy puff pastry fries tossed in cinnamon sugar topped with Eraâ€™s whisky vanilla caramel sauce, chocolate cake pieces, maple chip cream and chocolate sauce for dippingâ€.</p>\n<p>Dinner was delicious.</p>\n<p>I returned to Era 67 on a sunny fall day to share a delightful conversation with Executive Chef Ian Thompson; as with most of the Chefs and restaurateurs I have interviewed for Simcoe Dining, supporting local is their lifestyle. Local brings down the carbon foot print, improves the local economy, and it allows for the development of solid relationships with the farmers and growers of the food that Chef Ian brings into his establishment.</p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/farmers-markets-north-south-innisfil-orillia">Farmers Markets North and South; Innisfil and Orillia</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/sixteen-front-casual-fine-dining-lounge-orillia">Sixteen Front Casual Fine Dining and Lounge in Orillia</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/savour-flavours-2014">Savour the Flavours 2014</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>There are staples on the menu, but it is â€œtweakedâ€ seasonally to reflect the growing season.

Its soothing to converse and do an interview, itâ€™s finding another simpatico person who shares my belief that this isnâ€™t just about feeding the body itâ€™s about feeding the soul.

The restaurant is colourful, light and airy. The cozy chairs in the back corner near the fireplace create a pleasant space for lingering with your latte. I was privileged to view the photograph of the open kitchen design which will soon be installed, beautiful, trÃ¨s European indeed!</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-465" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-crepes.jpg" alt="chavo-crepes" width="588" height="338" srcset="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-crepes-300x172.jpg 300w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-crepes-500x287.jpg 500w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-crepes.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>\n<p>An open kitchen is a priority for them Karolina explains, â€œto watch how your food is prepared, to see the quality of the ingredients we use, to be served from the Chef, this matters to usâ€. A wine cellar corner is planned; this could be my fave corner, a variety of soups, salads and features of the day will be added to the menu, but crepes will remain the highlight. The crepes are very good! My favorite is the buckwheat crepe with goat cheese, greens and walnuts, accompanied by pear slices it is a perfect lunch or light dinner, while darling daughter prefers the vegetable crepe filled with a mÃ©lange of veggies.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-461" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-making_MG_8700.jpg" alt="chavo-making_MG_8700" width="588" height="425" srcset="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-making_MG_8700-134x97.jpg 134w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-making_MG_8700-415x300.jpg 415w, http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chavo-making_MG_8700.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>\n<p>Traditional dessert crepes are offered; the classic with clarified butter, brown sugar and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, strawberries or bananas more to your liking, or Nutella for hazelnut fans.

I have personal favourites, artists that leave me awestruck every time by their performances.

Stopping into Tara Indian Cuisine we caught a few songs from Carlos Del Junco, he blows a mean harmonica, while accompanied by Jimmy Bowskill on guitar. A quick street crossing was a step back in time, the speakeasy theme at Hudson fit the sway of the Bill Evans Trio. Dipping into Canvas and Cabernet for my first interview of the night with Wayne Buttery was a smooth move. As with every Blues musician I have spoken to, he refers to playing as a â€œlabour of love, if you are doing it for the money you are doing it for the wrong reasonsâ€. Wayneâ€™s inspiration to the Blues came back in the 60â€™s. â€œA long ways from the Mississippi Delta. I was walking by the Colonial Tavern in Toronto and I heard the music of James Cotton and Buddy Guy. Thatâ€™s where it all started. Someone once said I had to get a real job, but I have been fulfilling my lifeâ€™s dream since then, as a song writer, guitar player and singer.â€</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-489" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wayne-buttery-8.jpg" alt="wayne-buttery-8" width="580" height="487" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.waynebuttery.com/gp-who.html" target="_blank">http://www.waynebuttery.com/gp-who.html</a></p>\n<p>Sticky Fingers has a new location on Dunlop Street, this is the showcase venue for the big names. Jack de Keyzer had the opportunity to impress us twice at the festival, at the club with his full band, dance floor filled with couples of all ages bopping to his bluesy style. While he positively owned City Hall rotunda with his amazing one man show, â€œThe Evolution of the Blues Guitar.â€ A shout out to Jack de Keyzer for sharing his original script with me to read, while I write this review. Dear Jack; you simply must record this epic piece of material, it is a history lesson for the ears that belongs in the collection of all music lovers as a video or audio recording, â€˜tis brilliant! You took us on a journey from the â€œMississippi Delta Blues of the 1930â€™s to the psychedelic blues of Jimi Hendrix.â€</p>\n<p>Allow me to name drop from his music lesson; Robert Johnson, Lonnie Johnson, Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, T-Bone Walker, BB King, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Magic Sam, Otis Rush, Freddy King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, Little Richard, Isley Brothers, Wilson Pickett, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Cream, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Beck.</p>\n<p>You brought styles to your strings, from the spirituals to soul, R &amp; B, boogie woogie, swing and funk, then you added a kick of the wah wah pedal too.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-490" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-and-Munro_MG_9974.jpg" alt="Jack-and-Munro_MG_9974" width="588" height="381" /></p>\n<p>You captured us on the first note and kept us spellbound well past the encore!

During our interview I was totally captivated; this man needs to write a book, he has a natural rhythm and cadence on and off stage. He draws me in, first with his gratitude, â€œthat Iâ€™m still out thereâ€, then with the tales he tells. â€œIf anything I can contribute maybe I was one of the first guys to do it independently, like when there wasnâ€™t a road, I made a roadâ€. â€œI was fortunate that I was able to play with a lot of my idols, like Bo Diddley. A lot of guys played with him once or twice but we have played between 1973 and 2006, we maintained a friendship for that long and he took me under his wing and gave me tips and I learnt by playing with him to be an entertainer, not just a musician, I was happy he liked meâ€.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-496" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Paul-James_MG_0050.jpg" alt="Paul-James_MG_0050" width="588" height="467" /></p>\n<div class="alsoRecommended">\n<b>Also Recommended:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/february-blues-xvii">The February Blues XVII</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/barrie-jazz-blues-festival-2014">Barrie Jazz &amp; Blues Festival 2014</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.simcoedining.com/news_events/mayors-brunch-levee">Mayors Brunch and Levee</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>â€œBob Dylan, he invited me to play with him on quite a few occasions, we became friendsâ€. Remember Willy De Ville? Google the name if you donâ€™t, Paul shared he â€œtoured all over Europe with the band Mink De Ville in the early 80â€™s, met the Rolling Stones too, this new band out of Ireland, known as U2 opened for usâ€. Jeanne Beker admired his look, as he got â€œDe Villedâ€. Much Music knocked on his door, crescendo builds, I lean forward in my chair, it is hypnotic, yet Paul James is humble, grateful, and he says he feels very lucky.</p>\n<p>He had â€œgood mentors, amazing coincidences, made friends along the wayâ€. â€œFor the longest time I only looked forward but now I am looking back, I look at a picture and the picture will bring back all these storiesâ€.</p>\n<p>Paul James, Blues Musician.

I play from a traditional sense and I have come up with some stuff, a unique blend, kind of like a coffee or wine that sounds like me but based on things I have listened to. There is an expression you are what you eat, musicians are â€œyou are what you hearâ€. You take what you hear and you combine it in different ways and what ultimately comes out is a blending of our influences and itâ€™s a natural organic thing, nothing thatâ€™s forced.

I owed him a thank you.</p>\n<p>We chatted before the music started and he said I had to include this story in my review. Being the character that he is, he framed our meeting, decades before, thusly.</p>\n<p>â€œWrite that I picked you up, took you home and chastised you for what you didâ€ he said jokingly. To keep this story all agesâ€™ reader friendly I will share that Don Francks taught me a valuable life lesson. I had tried my hand at hitchhiking, he was the one that picked me up, drove me home, lectured me the entire way and threatened to tell my parents. He drove miles out of his way to get me there safely. Lesson learnt. Thank you sir!</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/don_MG_8748.jpg" alt="don_MG_8748" width="588" height="398" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-504" /></p>\n<p>That Sunday afternoon spent listening to Tony Quarrington play guitar while our Canadian icon, Don Francks did improvisational jazz singing storytelling was utterly engaging.</p>\n<p>The signature charcuterie tray, complete with balsamic bellavitano cheese photographed beautifully and tasted great!</p>\n<p>I returned to talk with Cyndi Taylor and learn how this combination of â€œwine, paint and funâ€ came to be. Raised on the east coast, Cyndi developed her strong work ethic from her mother, â€œif you canâ€™t find a job, make oneâ€ she taught her. Skilled as a seamstress, with a natural eye for design, this was Cyndiâ€™s first career. Time spent in Calgary introduced her to the restaurant world via an Irish Pub and to her husband, a professional musician. Together they travelled Europe, surrounded with music, food and wine, a delight to the senses. Year spent working in the healing arts of acupuncture and massage therapy helped hone her innate people skills. While a recent trip to California planted the proverbial seed for what would become Canvas and Cabernet.</p>\n<p>Reinvention was in Cyndiâ€™s vocabulary long before it became au courant.</p>\n<p>Self-described as â€œridiculously independentâ€ and a â€œwork horseâ€, both are great qualities in my opinion. While scouting for a location, she discovered the aforementioned â€œExpect Great Thingsâ€ sign, complete with an exceptional view of Kempenfelt Bay, this sealed the deal.</p>\n<p>Canvas and Cabernet was lovingly nurtured from design conception to open door reality.</p>\n<p>Cyndi shared that the name came from all the inspirational Câ€™s; Cyndi, Chianti, charcuterie, cheese, chocolate, Charley (her dog) Cee-Cee (her nick name) = Canvas and Cabernet!</p>\n<p>How does it all work you may ask; restaurant customers are welcome to enjoy a panini and salad at lunch, the menu is locally sourced and will change with the seasons.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cc-food2_MG_8813.jpg" alt="cc-food2_MG_8813" width="588" height="392" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-505" /></p>\n<p>In the evening may I suggest a glass of wine and a charcuterie tray in the cozy chairs or slide up to the bar and ask them to mix you a specialty drink.</p>\n<p>Canvas and Cabernet is the exclusive provider in Barrie of VQA wines from Rancourt Winery at Niagara on the Lake.</p>\n<p>Painting is a main course on the menu! Classes are held daily in the afternoons and twice in the evenings for two hour sessions. No experience is necessary for you to create your own masterpiece as a featured artist patiently walks you step by step through the process. Groups are welcome and encouraged. Imagine the fun and comradery for a bridal or baby shower, or gathering together a group of friends for an evening of creative, relaxing fun.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cc-artwork.jpg" alt="cc-artwork" width="588" height="336" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-506" /></p>\n<p>This is a great place for a date night or slide in solo to enjoy the ambiance. The creativity isnâ€™t just happening on the canvas, there are other great events too.</p>\n<p>Call ahead to ask about Mad Man Tuesdays, Turn Table Thursdays, or Friday Night Flights when the sommeliers will be in from the Niagara winery to sample varietals with cheese and chocolate pairings. I asked Cyndi to share her vision with my readers: â€œFor me itâ€™s investing in what I love, I am sitting here looking at it, itâ€™s right there, thatâ€™s my focus, investing in what I love, thatâ€™s my space in Barrie. Itâ€™s this view that I have, the warm welcome, itâ€™s the storytelling circle, itâ€™s the homemade presentation of food, thatâ€™s the wow factor, itâ€™s like the Maritime kitchen for me in a beautiful way, and I canâ€™t be different than that. I want people to sit and tell stories, I want to sit and listen to old music, to celebrate the past, to look at the future that is very quickly approaching.â€</p>\n<p>My eye for detail noticed small touches that are greatly appreciated when dining out; individual cloth hand towels in the ladies room, purse hooks at the tables, perfect lighting. It all works.</p>\n<p>Expect great things, you will be delighted!</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cc-outside_MG_8831.jpg" alt="cc-outside_MG_8831" width="588" height="449" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-507" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.canvasandcabernet.ca" target="_blank">http://www.canvasandcabernet.ca</a><br />\n(705) 238 1687 or 705 252 9463(WINE)<br />\n72 Dunlop St E<br />\nBarrie, ON, L4M 1A4<br />\n<a title="@canvasandcab" href="http://twitter.com/canvasandcab" target="_blank">@canvasandcab</a><br />\nWritten by: Penelope Morrow</p>\n<p><em>Penelope Morrow is a writer, editor and local food aficionado from Barrie, follow her tweetsÂ <a title="@penelopejmorrow" href="http://twitter.com/penelopejmorrow" target="_blank">@penelopejmorrow</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Photos by Celeste Morrow-Bailie &#8211; CMB Photography</em></p>\n<div style="text-align: center">Sponsored By:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Make your own photo book with <a href="http://www.photobookjoy.com.my" target="_blank" title="Beautiful Photo Books From PhotobookJoy Malaysia">Photobookjoy</a><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n', 'â€œExpect Great Thingsâ€.

The winter holiday season is another busy time at Il Buco, with family and business Christmas parties booking well in advance to assure their function is accommodated.</p>\n<p>The Dunlop Street entrance is somewhat inconspicuous, but there is ample parking and wheelchair accessibility when entering at the rear of the building from the Simcoe Street parking lot.</p>\n<p>I suspect that the condo dwellers nearby frequent Il Buco regularly given the location and the view! Enrico Angelucci, his wife Sue Varga and part owner Karl Sawyer have proudly operated from this second floor spot for seven years. They are most ably assisted in the kitchen by international Chef George Silva. With photographer daughter eager to accompany me, we each took a different approach to the menu, as at lunch there is the option of ordering a la carte or enjoying the three course Prix Fixe.</p>\n<p>Beef Carpaccio is a favourite of mine and I was pleased to see it makes an appearance here; this thinly sliced rare beef tenderloin is served with mixed greens, drizzled with olive oil and topped with grated fresh Parmigiano cheese. Delicious.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/il-buco-food.jpg" alt="il-buco-food" width="588" height="364" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-513" /></p>\n<p>From the three course Prix Fixe, the Classic Caesar Salad was darling daughters choice to start. While substitutions arenâ€™t generally offered, our server, owner Sue Varga, was most accommodating and graciously allowed the switch of gnocchi instead of Penne pasta, in the â€œFunghi Penne with mushrooms in a rosÃ© sauceâ€. While the gnocchi is not made in house, it presents with a rich flavourful sauce.</p>\n<p>I asked Sue Varga to choose lunch for me, her recommendation of Pork Scaloppini in a lemon white wine sauce with Italian salad was sized well, the light lemon zip of the pork was refreshing. Dessert is included with the Prix Fixe lunch and while I wouldnâ€™t usually have sweets at lunch, Sue strongly suggested that I try the Tiramisu. I am glad I did; the portion size was just right and the coffeeÂ flavour a great ending to the meal.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ilbuco-bar_MG_8850.jpg" alt="ilbuco-bar_MG_8850" width="588" height="392" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-511" /></p>\n<p>While a working lunch doesnâ€™t lend itself to wine sipping for me, nor does my editor recommend this, the wine list selections complement the foods, although I always like to see more of our fine Ontario VQA wines represented.</p>\n<p>I returned to talk with Enrico Angelucci and learnt just how committed he and Sue Varga are to the restaurant. Not many folks would commute from Muskoka to Barrie daily, but they do! When a friend showed them the location, they knew it would be ideal for a restaurant and the daily drive is taken in stride. The family is considering a move south to Barrie, as they have grown attached to the community that supports their restaurant and the waterfront at the doorstep too!</p>\n<p>Il Buco supports local where possible, shopping for produce at Cancillaâ€™s, Flying Monkeys brews are on tap, poultry and eggs from a Stayer producer and my personal fave Local Foods Mart, Enrico fondly referred to as â€œour emergency store, you need something you run out down there, and most of the time you find itâ€.</p>\n<p>Menu changes are small and subtle as their regular clientele, who tend to come every week or two expect tradition, the â€œsimple platesâ€. There are four or five specials added to the menu each weekend. â€œOsso Buco and Chicken Parmigiana will always be offered as people get attached to it.â€ â€œThe day we stop, people complainâ€.</p>\n<p>â€œBusiness is good; it has been growing steady since we openedâ€. As Enrico Angelucci proudly tells me, Il Buco Ristorante has been named as one of The Best 100 Restaurants in Canada, according to Open Table.</p>\n<p>In his own words; â€œFood is part of life, if you enjoy it with a glass of wine, there is nothing better really to end a day of work, you have a good day, a good meal at night, if everything was good for dinner you go to sleep happy, and a good glass of wine is always good, good wine makes good bloodâ€.<br />\nIâ€™ll drink to that!</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/il-buco_MG_8853.jpg" alt="il-buco_MG_8853" width="588" height="367" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-510" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.ilbucoristorante.com/ " target="_blank">http://www.ilbucoristorante.com</a><br />\ndining@ilbucoristorante.com<br />\n31 Dunlop Street E.

What a wonderful and timely coincidence that Chef Smith was visiting Orillia for a fundraising dinner to benefit the food banks, and that he is a personal friend of Chef Derek Mayes, Executive Chef at the Mariposa Inn where the Third Annual Simcoe County Region ORHMA (Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association) Awards were being held. The evening is a major fundraiser in support of student scholarships for those on a career path in Culinary, Tourism, Hotel and Resort Programs at Georgian College. The industry gathers to pay homage to their own, and while the goal is to raise money, everyone from students to CEOs and guests had a wonderful time tasting and talking. Having a Food Network star in the house, giving impromptu oyster shucking lessons, was the proverbial icing on the cake! Chef Daniel Clements assured me the honoured guest was quite approachable and indeed he was. Chef Smith charmed the room, conversations and photo ops created a buzz of energy in the venue that will long be remembered.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-522" src="http://www.blog.simcoedining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/orhma-Daniel_MG_0094.jpg" alt="orhma-Daniel_MG_0094" width="588" height="389" /></p>\n<p>The Culinary Students created the appetizers for the cocktail portion of the evening.

There are some significant differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>please</strong> review the changes if you have been developing against a beta or RC version.</p>\n<p>The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which had been an effort to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX for pagination, searches, and column sorts, and to consolidate the list-style screens into a single API that plugins could leverage. Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been entirely disabled for the list tables. We hope to bring this back again, in a form that is properly and fully implemented, in a future release. Column sorting remains, but everything else has returned to its 3.0 state.</li>\n<li><strong>For developers:</strong> The entire list table API is now marked <em>private</em>. If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':-)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>\n<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>. Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>\n<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>\n<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>\n<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>\n<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>\n<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>\n<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback.

The strengths and abilities of the people we bring on will define their roles with us. We like to put people in position to succeed.</p>\n<p>I think Crowd Favorite is a pretty unique place to work. We&#8217;ve got a small team (~12-15 people) with a strong technical focus, little &#8220;overhead&#8221; and no internal politics. It&#8217;s a true developer-centric environment.</p>\n<p>We get the privilege of working with wonderful clients on interesting and challenging projects. By the nature of our consulting and custom development business, we have the opportunity to work in a wide variety of technical areas. We do a lot of really interesting things with WordPress, and we also get to play with a lot of web services, create web-based applications, etc., etc. We tackle problems ranging from scaling back-end services to optimizing front-end delivery and user experience.</p>\n<p>Our basic criteria for taking on projects is: &#8220;will this be fun and/or interesting and/or challenging?&#8221; Trust me, you won&#8217;t get bored.</p>\n<p>We also create our own products &#8211; some internal and some that we make commercially available (expect a few more product releases as soon as we can package them up). The opportunity to work on both well-defined, specific problems and built long term products is a really great way to make sure we take a pragmatic approach to both.</p>\n<p>The work is demanding and you will be expected to understand what you need to do and largely manage your own time and deliverables &#8211; we don&#8217;t have babysitters. If you want an opportunity to learn and grow, to work with a team of great people, smart people, I want to hear from you.</p>\n<p>All of these positions are available in our Denver office. The non-intern positions are all full time with benefits. And you&#8217;ll get a pretty cool t-shirt.</p>\n<img src="http://alexking.org/wp/?ak_action=api_record_view&id=5293&type=feed" alt="" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Feb 2011 20:39:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WordPress Podcast: How To Monetize Your Blog";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"http://wp-community.org/?p=860";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://wp-community.org/2011/02/07/monetize-your-blog/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2505:"<p>So, you want to be a professional blogger?

How long does it take us to review and get a new theme online? What’s the most effective price ranges? How many themes and partners should we have? How do we promote the premium themes, while balancing adding new free ones? Will any of them ever be more popular than the Smoothie?

This version will have<a href="http://iosdev.wordpress.org/2011/01/26/push-notifications-are-coming-along-nice/"> Push Notifications</a>, as well as some restructuring behind the scenes to make the app more reliable. Some of you are still reporting issues with duplicated content, which we know we&#8217;ve solved in part but needs more looking into.

Many developers have been wondering how these post formats can be extended or how they can add some of their own. Although WordPress has always had hooks and filters to customize features added into the core, Post Formats strays from that routine by strongly discouraging straying from the standardized post formats. </p>\n<p>Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer <a href="http://andrewnacin.com/2011/01/27/on-standardized-post-formats">outlines why Post Formats work the way they do</a>. It&#8217;s important to note that Post Formats won&#8217;t be for everyone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With term names and such, we went through great lengths to ensure formats were as portable as possible. The idea behind the feature is this standardization and portability for a segment of bloggers. Many designers of themes used for microblogging wanted this ability to offer structured, well-defined content, beyond what could be done with categories and tags. It’s designed so when you switch to a different theme — a specific kind of theme, at that — your content doesn’t lose its most fundamental context.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Staying within the confines of the Post Formats standard will be good for all users but custom implementations will lead to problems when it comes time to switch themes. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Ultimately, this feature is an exception of the rule. It’s not like we decided we liked the idea of post formats and then later came across the idea to force them to be standardized. No, the idea we started with — before we had a name for them, even — was the standardization itself. The only new thing this feature brings to the table is the portability enabled through standardization. Without that, the feature is useless.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Overall, the why&#8217;s and hows of Post Formats is an interesting read and I&#8217;d love to see more posts like this from the core team when it comes to new features in WordPress. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/yA3DDlz38aQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 21:11:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 1/27";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=9592";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/TTGNp4klAE8/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1627:"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bug-library/"><strong>Bug Library</strong></a> provides an easy way to incorporate a bug/enhancement tracking system to a WordPress site.

The WordPress HelpCenter was a company aimed at providing support for plug-ins and themes to offload the support burden from developers. As Alex points out, the company was not able to gain traction with developers. But the nail in the coffin for something like WP HelpCenter is that commercial support for free plug-ins and themes was not something people were <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/twitter-tools-no-longer-posts-to-twitter#post-1876810">willing to pay for.</a> Alex believes that the service WP HelpCenter provided is still needed in the WordPress community and for anyone else willing to dive into the market, he shares the following tips:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would recommend getting funding in place so that you can hire and do internal training, then come to market with a 5-6 person team (with dedicated sales and project management roles) in place from the start. Then it’s just a matter of providing great service and doing smart marketing to generate revenue. I would also recommend including a training offering, as that seems to be a service many people find valuable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see who steps into the market that WP HelpCenter is leaving behind and if they do things a different way to become successful. Meanwhile. Alex&#8217;s development company <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/jobs/">CrowdFavorite is doing very well</a> with job openings available. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/jZSwmY41CxY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 22:23:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WordPress.tv: TJ Stein: Developing Fast & Scalable Servers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=4734";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wordpress.tv/2010/12/03/tj-stein-developing-fast-scalable-servers/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1769:"<div id="x-video-12" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/wptv.wordpress.com/4734/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=4734&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/12/03/tj-stein-developing-fast-scalable-servers/"><img alt="TJ Stein" src="http://videos.videopress.com/lIU6iZt4/tj_stein_wcla_2010_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 20:30:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"The Frosty";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordCamp SF 2011 Dates Set";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=9585";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/sZ0UE6TY8j8/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:898:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordcamp-sf-2011/">The dates have been set</a> for the largest annual WordCamp, <a href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a>.

While most of his questions are good ones, I&#8217;d say one of the most important is the aspect of support after you pay. Some commercial plugin providers have switched from unlimited support for the lifetime of the product to yearly subscriptions. For example, a plugin may cost $50.00 for the initial purchase which includes a year of support and upgrades but after the first year, you can opt to pay $25.00 for support or only the upgrades.

For customers that purchased WPHC support for the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/themes/carrington-business/">Carrington Business theme</a>, we have created a special premium support offering through <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> to fulfill your support needs from March 1 forward.<sup><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn1295989949726n" id="fn1295989949726" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>\n<p class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/5387932563/" title="WordPress HelpCenter is shutting down Feb 28th by alexkingorg, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5387932563_820936b589_m.jpg" width="240" height="217" alt="WordPress HelpCenter is shutting down Feb 28th" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the summary, here are the details.</p>\n<p>This was a really tough decision for me. When I <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2009/04/13/wordpress-helpcenter">created the HelpCenter</a> I had a couple of goals for it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a support and quick-turn development service to the WordPress community that I think it desperately needs.</li>\n<li>Provide relief for plugin and theme developers that don&#8217;t wish to offer support, and give their users a good resource for support when they need assistance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I never expected it to be a very profitable service due to the nature of the work we were targeting, but I thought it would fill a significant need.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we were not able to get the traction with developers that I was hoping for. Part of that may have been due to the $1 payout amount, so we were planning to increase that to 10% and created a set of tools to make it really easy for developers to include in their plugins. We never made this change or released these tools because their readiness coincided with the culmination of feedback from the community that commercial support for free plugins and themes just <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/twitter-tools-no-longer-posts-to-twitter#post-1876810" rel="external">wasn&#8217;t something they were willing to pay for</a>.</p>\n<p>When we initially started the service, we did so as a partnership with another hosting and development company. Unfortunately, didn&#8217;t work out as I&#8217;d hoped and <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2009/12/07/wordpress-helpcenter-staffed-by-crowd-favorite">we brought it in-house</a> and hired full time staff to help it grow. Since then we had as many as 4 full time staff on board.</p>\n<p>Hiring for WPHC was extremely difficult. We needed generalists that knew WordPress very well, that were also personable and comfortable talking with customers. It&#8217;s a hard combination to find, and harder still to find at a salary range that the WPHC projects could support. Ultimately many of them left, tired of dealing with the fraction of our customers that were rude and unpleasant.</p>\n<p>My experience building businesses is to grow them organically. This has worked well for Crowd Favorite and <a href="http://backupmoxie.com">BackupMoxie</a>, and is working nicely for <a href="http://cloudmoxie.com">CloudMoxie</a>; however it didn&#8217;t work well for WPHC.</p>\n<p>In retrospect (and as advice for the next person who decides to create a service like this), a different approach would have probably worked much better. I would recommend getting funding in place so that you can hire and do internal training, then come to market with a 5-6 person team (with dedicated sales and project management roles) in place from the start. Then it&#8217;s just a matter of providing great service and doing smart marketing to generate revenue. I would also recommend including a training offering, as that seems to be a service many people find valuable.</p>\n<p>I still think the concept of the WPHC is an important one for the WordPress community, and a service that is very much needed now that WordPress has made the transition from Open Source project to a product that many folks (who do not consider themselves technical) rely on and use on a daily basis. I hope that next foray into this space is more successful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At the same time, Crowd Favorite is flourishing nicely. We&#8217;ve got a number of open positions right now, including <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/jobs/">spots for interns and more experienced developers</a>.</p>\n<ol class="footnotes">\n<li id="fn1295989949726n">You will receive an email about this shortly.

conversations that were flying between the guests, both VIP project owners and developers alike. We continue to expand our <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com">VIP Services</a> offerings for both self-hosted and  WordPress.com VIPs, and the response has been very, very positive. One thing to us is clear &#8211; <strong>demand for WordPress is increasing</strong>, and our clients are hungry to apply it to all their upcoming projects.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re even happier when we tell them, &#8220;<strong>Yes, WordPress can do that, too!</strong>&#8221; Here on the Publisher blog, we&#8217;ll continue to highlight some of those outside-of-the-blog uses of WordPress (yep, <a

Just long press on the home screen, select &#8216;Shortcuts-&gt;QuickPress&#8217; and then select the blog that you would like to use. You will then have an icon on your home screen that takes you directly to the new post screen to start blogging straight away!</p>\n<h3>Share Post URL to Other Apps</h3>\n<p>You can now share a link to posts you&#8217;ve published on your blog to other Android apps.  Just tap the post title and then &#8216;Share URL&#8217;, and then select the app you want to share the link to.</p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>This release contains the following bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://android.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/102">Use EXTRA_SUBJECT when adding shared content to a post</a></li>\n<li><a

This year will mark the 5th anniversary of WordCamp, and as always will feature Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Word&#8221; address as well as a variety of amazing speakers that you&#8217;d normally only get to see at expensive industry conferences. This year the program will be expanded to three days, with programming for publishers, bloggers, and developers. There will also be related activities, like core team summits, workshops  for contributors, designers, and local organizers, and various professional and networking events. The planning is just beginning, so save the date on your calendar and keep an eye on the <a title="WordCamp SF 2011" href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp SF 2011</a> site (and/or follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/WordCampSF">@wordcampsf</a> twitter account) for updates as details become available.</p>\n<p>*For people who attended WordCamp SF last year who thought the annual event this year would be called WordCon, with WordCamp SF becoming a more locally-oriented event, you can read <a title="What\'s in a Name?

For 4 years I&#8217;m now writing plugins, I must admit that in the beginning I had no clue about queries, performance and traffic. I learned a lot from the code base of WordPress and improved my plugin&#8217;s as good as possible. <a href="http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/wp-table/">wp-Table</a>, my first public plugin is a mess if you look for database queries, never would do this again <img src=\'http://alexrabe.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':-)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' /> </p>\n<p>Today I&#8217;m focused on NextGEN-Gallery , which is a real challenge for me. It has a <a href="http://alexrabe.de/2010/10/24/80-000-blogs/">large</a> user base and is used in various way. I spend a lot of time for the upgrade process, so that a new version (hopefully) will not break your work. It&#8217;s real easy to write a new plugin, but when you have a lot of user, every single line needs to be reviewed. This makes the develeopment for my plugin so hard, I&#8217;m really no professional programmer, I never used or tested my work on high traffic blogs, never worked with large multi site environment, nexer used more than 1000 images.</p>\n<p>So instead of adding more and more features, I will work in the next time just on scalability and UI. <a href="http://alexrabe.de/2010/01/03/how-many-images-do-you-have-in-your-nextgen-gallery/">Some time ago I ask</a> how many images you have uploaded with NextGEN Gallery, and I&#8217;m really impressed about your response. But sadly this amount of images shows the current limits of my plugin. I never thought in this amount, so I programmed some features which are good for a couple of image/galleries, but not for hundreds of them.<br />\nOne big flaw is the TinyMCE Dialog window. You can select in the WYSIWYG Editor easily a image or gallery from the drop down field and insert the shortcode, but it&#8217;s a mess if you have 10000+ images. One first improvement is part of the upcoming V1.7.0 : Auto complete for drop down fields.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alexrabe.de/wp-content/uploads/dialog.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-759  aligncenter" title="New Tiny MCE dialog" src="http://alexrabe.de/wp-content/uploads/dialog.png" alt="" width="374" height="245" /></a></p>\n<p>With the help of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/">jQuery UI Autocomplete</a>, you can select one of the last 50 images or you can search for any image and select then the desired image. There are more places in the admin back end which need as well a full rework (i.e. Album management) but I just would like to get first your feedback on this new feature. I finished the first beta of V1.7.0 and it would be great if some of you can test this version. I&#8217;m already upgraded my test blog &amp; live system, so it should be stable enough to give it a shot. Let me know here in the comment section if you have any problem, or feel free to open a issue at my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nextgen-gallery/">Google Page</a>.
